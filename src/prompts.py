CHECKWORTHY_PROMPT = """
Your task is to identify whether texts are checkworthy in the context of fact-checking.
Let's define a function named checkworthy(input: List[str]).
The return value should be a list of strings, where each string selects from ["Yes", "No"].
"Yes" means the text is a factual checkworthy statement.
"No" means that the text is not checkworthy, it might be an opinion, a question, or others.
For example, if a user call checkworthy(["I think Apple is a good company.", "Friends is a great TV series.", "Are you sure Preslav is a professor in MBZUAI?", "The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in the basement of Encina Hall.", "As a language model, I can't provide these info."])
You should return a python list without any other words, 
["No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No"]
Note that your response will be passed to the python interpreter, SO NO OTHER WORDS!
