"H1567 Vol. 171 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2025 No. 65 House of Representatives The House met at 9 a.m. and was called to order by the Speaker. f PRAYER Dr. Michael Gossett, Green Acres Baptist Church, Tyler, Texas, offered the following prayer: Heavenly Father, we come to You today and acknowledge that You alone are the King of kings and Lord of lords."
You alone are sovereign over the nations and the peoples of the Earth.
"As Psalm 24:1 declares: ‘‘The Earth and everything in it; the world and its inhabitants belong to the Lord.’’ You alone, Lord, have ordained each government official to serve, and we ask that You raise up leaders and call each Representative to lead with justice and wisdom and humility."
We ask Your blessings on each Member here and the families and people they represent.
"I pray that You would grant each Representative clarity of mind, integrity of heart, and a deep concern for truth and righteousness according to Your Word."
I pray there would be no fear among them except a fear of the Lord.
"May they seek the good of people and the flourishing for all, especially the most vulnerable."
"Please remind us today, Lord, that our hope alone is in Your Son, Jesus Christ."
"We pray all this in the name of Jesus, our risen Lord and coming King."
Amen. f THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER.
The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House the approval thereof.
"Pursuant to clause 1 of rule I, the Journal stands approved."
Will the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. MCGARVEY) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance.
"Mr. MCGARVEY led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f WELCOMING GUEST CHAPLAIN DR."
"Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MORAN) is recognized for 1 minute."
"Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce Dr. Michael Gossett, pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas, to the United States House of Representatives to serve as the guest chaplain this week and offer a prayer this morning."
"Dr. Gossett and his wife, Katie, lead the largest congregation of believers in east Texas."
They also proudly shepherd a flock of four wonderful children at home.
"Pastor Michael, as he is known, and Katie are passionate about their call to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ."
"They are personable and approachable in their style, showing the same love and grace as our risen Lord and Savior."
"Having been a firefighter for 5 years before entering full-time ministry, this Liberty University alum is toughminded, disciplined, and steady in his leadership."
He is authentic and genuine and always faithful to preach the truth of the inherent Word of God.
"Because of that, he has been a strong and effective leader for Green Acres since he arrived in 2019."
I am proud to call him my friend and proud that he dedicated his life to being salt and light in this lost and dark world.
"To God be the glory for the great things He is doing through the Gossetts and Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas."
We welcome Pastor Gossett. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SESSIONS).
The Chair will entertain up to five further requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. f STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S ECONOMY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA.
"Mr. Speaker, the March jobs report shows that 228,000 jobs were added last month, far exceeding expectations."
"Private-sector growth led the way with 209,000 new jobs, nearly double the pre-election average."
Wages are rising with hourly earnings up nearly 4 percent over the past year.
"Government job dependence is shrinking with only 42 percent of new jobs in government-related sectors, down from nearly 75 percent under the Biden administration."
"Federal employment dropped by 4,000 as the administration cuts government bloat."
"In the 365-day period from the day President Trump was elected, there was a deficit of $2.2 trillion."
"In the 365 days previous to right now, it is only a deficit of $1.6 trillion."
"We have a long way to go, but it is a giant improvement."
"Construction jobs remain strong, and industrial production is hitting a record high."
Manufacturing output has grown nearly 1 percent over the month.
"Auto production has surged 8.57 percent, and core CPI inflation is at a 4year low, easing pressure on consumers."

Mr. MCGARVEY."
"Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago today, the blast of an AR–15 shattered a beautiful spring morning in Louisville as a lone gunman walked into Old National Bank on Main Street and opened fire."
"We lost Josh Barrick, Deana Eckert, Juliana Farmer, Jim Tutt, and my friend, Tommy Elliot."
"Five friends, neighbors, and loved one were taken too soon."
Among the eight wounded was Officer Nick Wilt.
"Just 10 days out of the academy, he bravely ran toward the gunman and was shot in the head."
"That same day, just blocks away at JCTC, two people were shot, and Chea’von Moore was killed at just 24 years old."
"Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a lifelong Louisvillian, still sad my community joined the long list of cities devastated by mass shootings."
"On behalf of all of our communities, we can and must do more to stop senseless gun violence. f CELEBRATING THE BUCKEYES’ SEASON (Mr. CAREY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CAREY."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Ohio State University Buckeyes whose remarkable victory in the 2025 College Football Playoff National Championship cements their legacy as one of the greatest teams in college football history."
"As those of us who watched the game, many of us on the edge of our seats, can attest, the championship is up for grabs until the clock runs out."
"However, we would be remiss not to mention the Buckeyes’ impressive overall season, where they secured wins over five different top five opponents."
This is something that has never been accomplished before.
"This season the Buckeyes boasted exceptional talent, strong coaching, and die-hard fans."
Woody Hayes once said that success is what you do with what you have got.
"As a fellow Buckeye, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the entire team and coaching staff for this incredible achievement. f MOVING JUSTICE FORWARD (Mr. BELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BELL."
"Mr. Speaker, every day nearly half a million Americans sit in local jails without a conviction, overwhelmingly for nonviolent, low-level offenses."
They are not there because they have been found guilty but because they can’t afford bail or are stuck waiting for their day in court.
"While they wait, taxpayers pay the price."
"That is why I have introduced the Justice Forward Agenda, a target, results-driven plan to reduce crime and use taxpayer dollars more wisely."
The Community First Pretrial Reform and Jail Decarceration Act helps local jurisdictions cut unnecessary pretrial detention and expand proven alternatives.
"The DART Act builds off my work as a St. Louis County prosecutor by giving law enforcement better tools like diversion programs and mental health courts to connect people with treatment, housing, and support that actually stops the cycle of incarceration."
"It is about investing in what works, in what has proven effective, and building safer, stronger communities."
"Mr. Speaker, let’s move justice forward. f HONORING THE LIFE OF FORT BEND COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTY DAVID FONTENOT (Mr. NEHLS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NEHLS."
"Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a good friend, Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Deputy David Fontenot."
"David was a dedicated law enforcement officer with over 30 years of service, 26 of those years with the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office."
"David and I worked many long days, serving and protecting our community."
He was not only a great sheriff’s deputy but he was also a great friend.
He was a man that I could depend on and a true professional.
"I am saddened to say that on March 29, my friend, David, passed away after a battle with cancer."
"My prayers are with his family and loved ones, especially his sister, Camile, and his brothers, Chuck, Michael, and Stephen."
"Mr. Speaker, I and the entire law enforcement community of Fort Bend County, Texas, will miss him dearly."
God bless him. f HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING (Mr. SORENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SORENSEN.
"Mr. Speaker, April 19 will mark 30 years since the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in the United States, when 168 innocent lives were taken on that quiet morning in Oklahoma City."
"As many as 750 people were hurt, and thousands more were scarred by trauma."
The main perpetrator was radicalized by extreme hate toward the Federal Government.
"He was quickly captured, convicted, and put to death for his crimes."
"Today, we think of the toddlers at the Murrah building’s daycare center who would be in their thirties today."
"We pray for their moms and their dads, but we must also pray for our country again."
The rise in political tribalism and the hate for others must stop.
Our faith in this government must never be diminished in any way that turns to hate and violence.
"American author Napoleon Hill wrote that ‘‘Every adversity, every failure, and every heartache carries a seed of an equal or greater benefit.’’ May we never forget those words. f b 0915 CONGRATULATING GREENFIELDCENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL FOR WINNING THE INDIANA STATE ROBOTICS CHAMPIONSHIP (Mr. SHREVE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHREVE."
"Mr. Speaker, the robotics industry is quietly reshaping the manufacturing and distribution economies of Indiana and our world."
I rise today to congratulate a team of extraordinary young students at Greenfield-Central High School back home in my district for their winning performance at our Indiana State robotics competition.
Greenfield-Central’s team surpassed 62 other terrific Hoosier teams to claim top honors.
"Coach Jason led The Exothermics, Greenfield Central’s team, comprised of juniors Simon, Hayley, and Brayden."
These talented young Hoosiers will again showcase their talents at VEX World competition in Dallas later this year.
"These students exemplify the best of the next generation of innovators, engineers, and scientists."
Their work underscores the importance of a STEM education.
"Many Hoosiers have celebrated victories on basketball courts, and I am proud to take this opportunity to spotlight these victories of our young Hoosiers in robotics innovation."
Their talented minds will reshape our economy. f TARIFFS (Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania.
"Mr. Speaker, in just 2 days, Wall Street lost $6 trillion in value in the worst selloff since 2020."
"Many of my constituents lost tens of thousands of dollars, money saved over decades."
"Now we are all scrambling with the news of a 90-day pause on tariffs after VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:58 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.002 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1569 April 10, 2025 President Trump swore up and down he would do no such thing."
"Sadly, we cannot trust a word our President says, let alone plan around his erratic behavior."
Mr. Trump’s turbulent game of chicken with some of our closest allies is absurd.
How does Mr. Trump expect people whose 401(k)s and kids’ college savings accounts just took a nosedive to feel secure in their retirement?
How does he expect people to save for retirement at all?
"The short answer is that the President does not know, and, even worse, he does not care."
"Mr. Speaker, the President lost $11 trillion in value in the first 11 weeks of his second term."
I call upon my Republican colleagues to please call out the President’s destructive decisions.
It is time to say that the emperor has no clothes. f RECOGNIZING THE FLORIDA GATORS (Mrs.
CAMMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2025 men’s basketball NCAA national champions, the Florida Gators."
"On Monday night, the Gators defeated the University of Houston in the national championship game to become the three-time national champions, winning the first title since the 2006– 2007 season."
"Led by Coach Todd Golden, the Gators were one of four tournament one-seeds, advancing through the rounds of 64 and 32 before dancing their way through the Sweet 16, Elite Eight, and Final Four."
"After winning the title this week, the Gators ended the season with a 36–4 record making Gainesville, a/k/a Titletown, incredibly proud."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Golden, the entire team, and, of course, the Gator nation."
"As always, it is so great and sweet to be a Florida Gator."
Go Gators. f SAFEGUARD AMERICAN VOTER ELIGIBILITY ACT Mr. STEIL.
"Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 294, I call up the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require proof of United States citizenship to register an individual to vote in elections for Federal office, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration."
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
"Pursuant to House Resolution 294, the bill is considered read."
"The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 22 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1."
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act’’ or the ‘‘SAVE Act’’.
"Not later than 10 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Election Assistance Commission shall adopt and transmit to the chief State election official of each State guidance with respect to the implementation of the requirements under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.), as amended by section 2."
"Subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Paperwork Reduction Act’’) shall not apply with respect to the development or modification of voter registration materials under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.), as amended by section 2, including the development or modification of any voter registration application forms."
DUTY OF SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO NOTIFY ELECTION OFFICIALS OF NATURALIZATION.
"Upon receiving information that an individual has become a naturalized citizen of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly provide notice of such information to the appropriate chief election official of the State in which such individual is domiciled."
RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS.
"Nothing in this Act or in any amendment made by this Act may be construed to supercede, restrict, or otherwise affect the ability of an individual to cast a provisional ballot in an election for Federal office or to have the ballot counted in the election if the individual is verified as a citizen of the United States pursuant to section 8(j) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (as added by section 2(f))."
RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING EFFECT ON STATE EXEMPTIONS FROM OTHER FEDERAL LAWS.
Nothing in this Act or in any amendment made by this Act may be construed to affect the exemption of a State from any requirement of any Federal law other than the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.).
"This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with respect to applications for voter registration which are submitted on or after such date."
The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration or their respective designees.
The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. MORELLE) each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.
"Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include additional material on the bill."
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin?
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, known as the SAVE Act, introduced by my colleague, CHIP ROY of Texas."
"As chairman of the Committee on House Administration, I have been focused on improving election integrity and increasing confidence in our elections."
Let me be clear: Noncitizen voting reduces confidence in our elections.
"American elections are for American citizens, and we intend to keep it that way."
The SAVE Act will strengthen our elections administration and restore Americans’ confidence in our elections.
"The SAVE Act contains critical reforms to update the National Voter Registration Act which currently requires States to give registration forms to everyone who receives a driver’s license, regardless of citizenship."
The bill before us will help States prevent noncitizens from voting in Federal elections by requiring States to obtain documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote in Federal elections.
"Mr. Speaker, you are sure to hear from my colleagues on the other side that noncitizen voting doesn’t exist or that it rarely happens so we don’t need to do anything about it."
It couldn’t be further from the truth.
"However, let’s look back 2 months ago."
The secretaries of state that I had conversations with shared with me their difficulties that they are experiencing in administering the most recent election.
Two of their top concerns were about integrity of voter rolls and noncitizen voting.
"In a most recent election, we just saw 13 individuals referred by the Michigan Secretary of State to the attorney general for noncitizen voting in the State of Michigan."
"In the House of Representatives where we often see close elections, we have one Member here who won her election by simply six votes."
It is clear we must pass the SAVE Act and prevent noncitizen voting.
"There have also been many other examples of noncitizens voting or being VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:58 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10AP7.001 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1572 April 10, 2025 on States’ voter rolls."
"Just a few years ago, Illinois removed almost 600 noncitizens from its voter rolls."
"In Pennsylvania almost 10,000 noncitizens were removed from their voter rolls."
"In Georgia an audit recently determined that more than 1,600 noncitizens had attempted to register to vote."
Every State also needs access to the tools necessary to remove noncitizens from their voter rolls.
Right now States don’t have free access to the Federal data that tracks citizenship status.
Another crucial element of the SAVE Act will provide States with cost-free access to existing Federal and State databases so they can perform this important voter list maintenance.
In recent years we have seen an increasing number of jurisdictions across the country allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections.
"Right here in our Nation’s Capital, noncitizens are eligible to vote in these municipal elections."
"In Washington, D.C., a noncitizen only has to reside in the District for 30 days in order to register to vote."
"Mr. Speaker, 388 noncitizens cast ballots here in our Nation’s Capital in Washington, D.C., in the most recent election."
By passing the SAVE Act we can ensure that only eligible Americans are registering to vote.
"Additionally, the SAVE Act is aligned with President Trump’s recent executive order, Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of Elections, which will help restore trust in American elections, enhance our election administration, and make our elections secure."
This legislation is just one step that we can take to ensure President Trump’s executive order could not be undone.
Americans deserve to have confidence in our elections.
We must pass the SAVE Act to prevent noncitizen voting and secure our elections.
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, together with President Trump’s recent voting-restrictive executive order, the SAVE Act would cripple American elections."
It would end voter registration in the United States as we know it.
The SAVE Act would end mail-in registration.
"You heard that right, Mr. Speaker."
"All those States and all those people who register by mail—not vote by mail—registration by mail, it would end that."
American citizens would have to appear in person at an election office and bring with them various documents and forms to register to vote.
"Just to exercise your fundamental, inalienable rights as a citizen of this country, Republicans would force Americans into a paperwork nightmare, burying voter registration under a mountain of bureaucracy and red tape."
So what exactly would the SAVE Act do?
It would create enormous burdens for every American citizen who seeks to register to vote.
"As my Republican colleague and friend admitted at the Rules Committee, under the SAVE Act, most Americans would be unable to register to vote using their REAL ID."
"Further, under the SAVE Act, almost 70 million American women will be unable to register to vote using their birth certificate simply because they changed their name upon marriage."
"The bill would disenfranchise survivors of domestic abuse who have changed their names for safety purposes, which is truly shocking."
"The SAVE Act will also have a steep financial cost to American citizens because, yes, the SAVE Act does allow Americans to use their passports to register to vote, but one-half of all Americans do not have a passport, and a passport costs $130 plus additional fees."
So the SAVE Act would cost American voters who do not have passports billions of dollars to secure them.
Americans are facing rising costs exacerbated by the recent Trump tariffs.
Economists are warning about a looming Trump recession.
The SAVE Act would force U.S. citizens to spend billions of dollars to register to vote.
"This includes rural voters, many of whom now register to vote online or by mail, who will be forced to drive hours and cross hundreds of miles to present documentary proof."
"This includes senior citizens who are particularly likely to lack documentary proof of citizenship, including passports, copies of their birth certificates, or other documents."
What about the men and women in uniform who serve our country all over the world?
Can a member of our military use their military ID?
"Surely military IDs should be enough to register to vote, but not according to the SAVE Act."
Servicemembers will need to bring their military ID and a copy of their service record showing their place of birth within the United States.
"However, many servicemembers were born abroad, say to military parents overseas."
Those servicemembers will be blocked from using their military ID to register to vote.
"Mr. Speaker, do you remember the SAVE Act’s requirement that Americans show their documentation in person at an election office?"
The SAVE Act will prevent members of our Armed Forces from registering to vote while deployed overseas.
"Moreover, the SAVE Act is not actually meant to prevent noncitizens from voting."
The SAVE Act is really about silencing Americans.
"This bill is about disenfranchising Americans, not noncitizens, but Americans, Americans like James Wilson."
James Wilson is an Arizona voter whom I met with last week.
He was meant to join us in the gallery.
"He flew all the way to Washington, D.C., last week to watch Congress debate the SAVE Act."
He was forced to fly home after the Speaker canceled 3 days of legislative work.
"Mr. Wilson is an American citizen, born in Japan to a military father during the Vietnam war."
Mr. Wilson is also a veteran.
"He proudly served our Nation overseas, including in Korea and Germany."
"Like millions of Americans, Mr. Wilson does not have a passport because he does not need a passport."
"Like millions of Americans, Mr. Wilson does not have access to his birth certificate."
"When Arizona introduced a restrictive voter registration law, a law just like the SAVE Act, Mr. Wilson’s right to vote was imperiled."
Mr. Wilson did not have any of the documents required by the Arizona law and required by the SAVE Act to prove his citizenship.
"But for a last-minute emergency court order, Mr. Wilson, an American citizen, a veteran, and a patriot, would not have been able to vote this past election."
"If the SAVE Act becomes law, Americans nationwide will face the same bureaucratic nightmare that Mr. Wilson faced in Arizona."
The SAVE Act will force Americans like Mr. Wilson to pay billions of dollars to exercise their inviolable right to vote.
"House Republicans want to increase the burdens and amplify the costs in time, in money, and in effort for American citizens to vote."
"The SAVE Act would cost American citizens something deeply important, something essential to the soul of this Nation, the right to freely and fairly participate in our elections."
"Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge defeat of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. b 0930 Mr. STEIL."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. LEE), the chair of the Subcommittee on Elections and the former Florida secretary of state."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or the SAVE Act."
The SAVE Act is an important step forward that will ensure elections are more secure and accurate across the United States.
The vast majority of Americans agree that only U.S. citizens should have the right to vote in our elections.
"Just last month, President Trump took a strong stance reaffirming his commitment to the integrity of our elections."
The President’s executive order will help equip election officials with better data and more resources to administer elections.
"Today, Congress has the opportunity to build on this momentum and ensure that these protections are part of our laws, that every State can follow these VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:58 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.006 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1573 April 10, 2025 practices, and that voters across the Nation can feel confident in the integrity and security of their elections."
Congress must commit to supporting election officials and voters by making voting accessible and secure.
"While States are the primary authority on how elections are conducted on election day, it is our role here in Congress to ensure that we support them, provide resources to them, and promote uniformity and best practices across the country."
One way that we will be able to help provide those resources to States is by passing the SAVE Act.
The SAVE Act will help protect our elections and ensure that only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections.
The bill will support State and local election officials by providing them with data and tools to help verify the accuracy and completeness of their voter rolls.
"As Florida’s former secretary of state and chief election official, I got to work with State and local elections workers across the country and saw their commitment to ensuring strong elections."
"Now, as the chair of the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections, I am proud to work alongside Chairman STEIL to advance policies that lead to stronger elections across our country."
These tools will help the States ensure their rolls are accurate and help prevent any unintended errors.
"We know that some States have continued to discover noncitizens on their voter rolls, and there is evidence that some of them have voted in recent elections."
We must take steps to ensure this doesn’t continue.
"Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the claim that the SAVE Act will somehow negatively affect married women or others who might have changed their name because their legal documentation or identification may reflect two different names."
"This legislation clearly contemplates exactly this situation and, indeed, directly addresses it."
"Page 14, line 19 directs the States to create a process for addressing this exact issue."
The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Florida."
"Mr. Speaker, ever since the 19th Amendment passed over 100 years ago, married women have been registering to vote and successfully voting."
"This bill will accommodate women who change their name and have not yet updated their documentation to reflect a name change because the SAVE Act explicitly directs States to establish a process for them to register to vote, irrespective of those discrepancies."
"Like other areas of the law, citizens will be able to use combinations of existing identification documents in order to register to vote."
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the work of my colleagues from the committee."
"We agree on many things, but this is certainly not one of them."
"I want to reflect on what the gentlewoman from Florida and others have said several times, that the SAVE Act allows States to create a process to provide additional proof of citizenship."
Why not write it in the bill?
Why are we making the potential for 50 different standards to be set to prove citizenship?
"What additional forms would be used, a birth certificate together with an ID, also including a marriage certificate, also including a record of a changed name?"
What must survivors of domestic abuse provide?
"Must they provide court orders protecting them from stalkers, restraining orders, divorce records, divorce papers?"
How much paperwork do Republicans want Americans to drown in?
"Further, how long will these new rules take?"
The SAVE Act takes effect immediately.
What if States take months or years to amend their systems?
What if they never do it?
"You might have someone interested in voting, but their State hasn’t acted."
"They have no way of proving that the name on their birth certificate, which differs from the name on their ID, is because they got married."
They would be unable to register to vote.
Here is what we do know.
"President Trump’s executive order doesn’t want any alternative forms of identification, no alternative State processes, no additional avenues for voters."
"Why would we expect the EAC to disregard the President’s clear desire to limit documentary proof of citizenship to a small, exclusive, difficult-to-obtain list of options?"
"I would say in addition to my dear friend—and I mean that sincerely—the gentleman from Wisconsin, I would like to remind him that an estimated 165,000 women in his district in Wisconsin have a different name on their birth certificate than is on their current photo ID."
"Under the SAVE Act, these women could not register using their birth certificate alone."
"Roughly 340,000 residents in Wisconsin’s First District lack a passport, so the SAVE Act could cost voters in the district $45 million if they chose to comply that way."
"I would also like to remind my colleague and friend, Representative LEE, an estimated 170,000 women in her district have a different name on their birth certificate than on their photo ID."
"Likewise, under this bill, these women could not use their birth certificate to register to vote because they have a different name now than at birth."
"Roughly 368,000 residents of Florida’s 15th District lack a passport."
It would cost voters in the district at least $47.8 million to secure a passport to register to vote.
This is what the bill requires.
We should not gloss over it because this is a mountain of bureaucratic red tape.
"If you can’t get it right in the bill, if you don’t list marriage license in the Federal bill, and it is left to the States, who knows how and when we resolve these issues."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI)."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding."
I rise today in strong opposition to the SAVE Act.
"This bill will make it more difficult to register to vote, and it will prevent millions of American citizens, including married women who change their name and rural Americans, from exercising their right to vote."
"It creates an enormous and expensive unfunded mandate on election offices, and for what?"
Federal law already requires people to attest under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote.
"Noncitizens attempting to register to vote is exceedingly rare, and if they do, they face severe consequences, including fines, up to 5 years in prison, and deportation."
"Mr. Speaker, more than 140 million Americans do not have a passport."
Approximately 70 million women do not have a birth certificate that matches their current legal name.
Millions and millions of rural voters would have to travel long distances to try to register to vote.
We don’t have to guess what would happen if this bill were to pass.
"In 2011, Kansas had a proof-of-citizenship requirement."
The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Oregon an additional 15 seconds."
"Mr. Speaker, in Kansas, more than 30,000 U.S. citizens, 12 percent of everyone seeking to register to vote, were barred from voting."
"In all of them, a significant number of citizens have been wrongly barred from voting."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs."
"MILLER), a member of the Committee on House Administration, to speak on the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the SAVE Act, which includes robust measures to prevent illegal aliens from participating in our elections."
"Under Joe Biden, millions of illegal aliens flooded into our country, and many were given the benefits and privileges that should be reserved for American citizens."

"They received welfare benefits, CDL licenses, and State identification."
The Democrats have even voted to allow them to be law enforcement officers.
"I do not have to tell you how dangerous this situation is for Americans, especially for Americans’ confidence in the sanctity of our elections."
"As far-left jurisdictions seek to allow illegals to vote in local elections, let me be clear about this one thing at this point: Every vote cast by an illegal alien is a vote stolen from an American citizen."
Congress must defend the integrity of our elections.
We must aggressively push back against the left’s attempts to change the electorate and dilute the voices of actual Americans in our democratic process.
"This past week and today, all we hear are the Democrats sharing their concerns that rural Americans, women, and people of color are not capable of getting an ID."
This is insulting and condescending and an untrue argument.
You need an ID for most everything else in daily life.
Maybe if the Democrats would quit pushing for our schools— The SPEAKER pro tempore.
The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Illinois."
"Mr. Speaker, maybe the Democrats should quit wasting so much time in our public schools indoctrinating our children and, instead, teach them real-life skills such as reading, civics, and how to get an ID."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to make note of the point that REAL ID in the United States does not have citizenship in almost all States."
You couldn’t even use your REAL ID.
"If we are talking about voter ID and photo ID, it doesn’t even allow you to vote under the SAVE Act."
The gentlewoman should read the bill.
"It doesn’t allow it, and I think that is part of the problem."
"I would also note, Mr. Speaker, in Representative MILLER’s district, an estimated 150,000 women have a different name on their birth certificate than their current photo ID."
"Under the SAVE Act, these women could not use their birth certificate to register to vote and would not be able to use their ID, their driver’s license."
"Roughly 414,000 residents of Illinois’ 15th District lack a passport."
The SAVE Act would cost voters in Mrs.
MILLER’s district $53.8 million should they avail themselves of a passport to prove the requirements of the SAVE Act.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS)."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the SAVE Act, which is a transparent attempt to disenfranchise millions of voters."
The SAVE Act would change voter registration guidelines to require proof of U.S. citizenship in very narrow ways.
"However, those documents, as we have heard, a birth certificate or a passport, are not always easy to come by for certain Americans."
This backward legislation would immediately disenfranchise the 69 million women who have changed their names after marriage or divorce and do not have a matching birth certificate.
There is no cure in this bill.
Millions of Americans would be forced to navigate the complicated process to change their birth certificate or be forced to pay more than $130 for a passport.
Who would be prevented from voting?
Working people who don’t have the time to do it and low-income people who cannot afford to do it would be prevented from voting.
House Democrats will not be silenced while Donald Trump and Republicans try to disenfranchise millions of people.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) to speak on the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, in every election, somebody wins and somebody loses."
"Democracy depends on the losing side trusting that the election was a fair and accurate reflection of the will of the majority, and the winning side depends on the same perception for the legitimacy of their office. b 0945 For centuries, our elections were the gold standard for the world because they were very hard to cheat in."
"Essential components of this process were 30day registration, in-person election day voting, and proof of identity."
"In recent years, in many States, the woke left has torn down these safeguards."
"Mail-in ballots where there is no chain of custody, counting ballots weeks after election day, counting ballots in secret, ballot harvesting, sameday registration, turning election day into election month, and forbidding proof of identity all make cheating easy and destroy the public’s confidence in the process."
"In many jurisdictions, the Democrats have made it clear that they intend to allow noncitizens to vote, the ultimate in foreign election interference."
I have news for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: American elections are for Americans.
The SAVE Act restores this vital principle by requiring proof of citizenship and identity in the Federal elections that affect every American.
"Americans should pay close attention to this vote, for it will reveal those who would subvert their vote to foreign nationals."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman that, in the United States of America, you have to be a U.S. citizen to vote in a Federal election."
"If you are not, you are subject to penalties for attempting to register to vote, and you are subject to felonies and deportation if you do vote and are not an American citizen."
"I also remind my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), that an estimated 135,000 women in his district have a different name on their birth certificate than they have on their current photo ID, and roughly 290,000 residents of California’s Fifth District lack a passport."
The cost to those voters would be $37.7 million to get passports.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS), my dear friend."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Congresswoman for Georgia’s Fifth District, the cradle of the civil rights movement and the home of Dr. King, Ambassador Andrew Young, and my predecessor, the late Congressman John Lewis."
I carry their legacy with me every time I walk onto this floor.
"Mr. Speaker, the SAVE Act is everything our civil rights leaders fought against."
Don’t think that it won’t impact you or folks that you know.
"If you got married and changed your name, your ID won’t match your birth certificate."
"If you don’t have a passport and your ID doesn’t match your birth certificate, you can’t prove your citizenship."
"According to the SAVE Act, you won’t be able to vote."
"Right now, under Trump and Musk’s disastrous economy, families like so many of those who I represent back home in Georgia are struggling to keep up with the cost of groceries, let alone adding $130 for a passport just to register to vote."
"In Georgia, over half of the population doesn’t have a passport, and our driver’s licenses, even the REAL ID, don’t prove citizenship."
This resolution could force Georgians to pay more than $700 million just to register to vote.
"Mr. Speaker, that is a poll tax, plain and simple, and it is blatant voter suppression."
The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Georgia."
"Mr. Speaker, voter suppression by any other name is still voter suppression."
"This resolution violates the 14th Amendment, 19th Amendment, 24th Amendment, and every tenet of a free and inclusive democracy."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this disgrace of a voter suppression resolution."

"Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs."
"BICE), a member of the Committee on House Administration."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or the SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, under President Biden, nearly 5 million illegal aliens were released into the United States."
Biden’s failure at the southern border has diluted the voting power that is reserved for only American citizens.
This crisis is not only a national security concern but one that can seriously alter the outcome of our elections.
"Just this past election cycle, both the States of Alabama and Virginia removed thousands of registered voters who were not American citizens."
"Securing our elections is of paramount importance, and we must ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat."
"The SAVE Act will strengthen our election administration, improve voter confidence, and ensure that American elections are only for American citizens."
"Specifically, it amends the National Voter Registration Act to require States to obtain proof of citizenship when an individual registers to vote."
"Mr. Speaker, let me be clear."
"This legislation does not prohibit married women from voting, and the absurd narrative of this has gotten out of control."
"Mr. Speaker, when someone changes their name, just as I have when I got married, they have to provide their birth certificate and a marriage certificate."
"This is already required when you update your ID, your Social Security records, and, yes, your voter registration, too."
"When your name is legally changed, it updates across government systems."
"REAL IDs, passports, and other valid forms of ID mentioned in the SAVE Act are sufficient proof of citizenship."
Your birth certificate doesn’t have to match your current ID.
"I will add this: The claim is that it will disenfranchise married women and others who might have to change their names because the documentation might show two different names, but the SAVE Act itself addresses this point in the text."
"Page 14, line 9 directs the States to create a process for addressing this exact issue."
I find myself asking: Why are the Democrats refusing to take steps to safeguard our elections and protect the votes of every single American citizen?
"Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the SAVE Act, and I look forward to voting for it."
I encourage my colleagues to do the same.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I hate to disagree with my dear friend, the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs."
"BICE), but the words ‘‘marriage certificate’’ do not appear anywhere in the SAVE Act."
"In fact, it could have been written in that way since Republicans are adding all these lists and requirements for people to do."
"Yet, it actually does make it harder for almost 70 million American women to vote."
Eighty-four percent of women choose their husband’s name when they get married.
"As we have discussed, under the SAVE Act, most Americans will be unable to use the standard-issued driver’s license when registering to vote because most REAL IDs don’t include citizenship on them."
They don’t automatically update if you haven’t registered at all.
"When you go to register, there is nothing to update."
"In the case of Mary Beth Bauer, that is what it says on her certificate."
Her driver’s license now says ‘‘Mary Beth Morelle.’’ She would not be able to register using those two pieces of information.
"She would have to get an additional piece of documentation to register, which is not identified in the SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, I think we have talked about it at length."
This is clearly intended to make it much more difficult.
"According to House Republicans, none of these women should be allowed to register to vote."
They are roughly 25 percent of the U.S. citizen voting age population.
I also suggest to my friend from Oklahoma (Mrs.
"BICE) that an estimated 179,000 women in her district have a different name on their birth certificate than a current photo ID, and roughly 394,000 residents of Oklahoma’s Fifth District lack a passport."
The SAVE Act would cost them $51.3 million to secure passports.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MULLIN), my dear friend."
"Mr. Speaker, free and fair elections are the foundation of any functioning democracy."
"The SAVE Act is a blatant attempt to undermine our election system, weaken American democracy, and unfairly suppress millions of eligible citizens from voting."
"If the SAVE Act becomes law, eligible Americans would have to provide either a passport or a birth certificate to register to vote and cast their ballots."
"About half of American citizens, roughly 150 million people, don’t own a passport."
"If an eligible voter doesn’t have the means to pay for a passport, they would need a birth certificate that states their current legal name."
This act could suppress the votes of millions of women in this country who have changed their names after marriage.
"To be clear, if you are a married woman, I guess Republicans don’t want you to vote."
"If you can’t afford a passport, Republicans don’t want you to vote."
"If you are a college student whose birth certificate is back home, Republicans don’t want you to vote."
Congress has a responsibility to ensure that all eligible citizens can participate in free and fair elections.
The SAVE Act would do the opposite.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. BOEBERT)."
"Mr. Speaker, bless my colleagues’ hearts on the other side of the aisle for using married women as a gotcha for voting."
I have never had to bring my birth certificate to prove that I was a registered voter.
I have an ID that has a different name than my birth certificate.
"Also, since we are using women as bait here, maybe in the next round of debates, Democrats could explain to us exactly what a woman is."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SAVE Act."
"The American people are done messing around with a woke, weak-kneed system that lets our elections get hijacked."
"I am fighting for them, for me, and for every American who knows that our vote is sacred."
It is time to lock it down with citizens only.
"Mr. Speaker, let’s cut the crap."
"Right now, people can walk up, check a box claiming that they are a citizen, and, boom, they are registered for Federal elections with no proof and no ID."
That is not a system built on trust.
"It is a system vulnerable to error, fraud, and exploitation."
"In Colorado, the process was just expedited for illegals to receive a driver’s license."
"In the State of Colorado, when you obtain a driver’s license, you register to vote."
The SAVE Act is a commonsense measure designed to protect the integrity of our electoral process.
"At its core, it requires proof of citizenship to register to vote in Federal elections."
It is a basic safeguard to ensure that only those who are legally entitled to participate in our elections can do so.
This isn’t about denying anyone’s right to vote.
"It is about protecting the rights of every American citizen, not adding votes and subtracting American citizens’ votes."
"Mr. Speaker, I support the SAVE Act."

The SAVE Act could cost them $36.9 million to secure passports in order to register to vote.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the SAVE Act."
"The bottom line is that the SAVE Act suppresses the votes of women; Black, Brown, and indigenous people; veterans; and working-class Americans."
"In advancing it, Republicans invoke those historical policies that were intended to disenfranchise Americans."
"Let me remind Members what they were: literacy tests and poll taxes for eligible voters, grandfather clauses that tied voters’ rights to the grandfathers before the Civil War, all-White primaries to eliminate Black voters’ presence in the electoral process, and now: Show me your papers."
"The SAVE Act is the same trash, just a different day."
It is the Republicans’ latest attempt to make clear who the majority believes should have access to vote and who should not.
"Anyone who votes for this resolution will go down in the history books with the likes of Confederate politicians, Jim Crow advocates, and white supremacists as bigots."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. STEIL."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs."
CAMMACK) to speak on the resolution.
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution as a woman and as the chairwoman of the Republican Women’s Caucus, not only for election integrity but clearly literacy because Democrats have not read the resolution."
It ensures that only American citizens can vote in our Federal elections.
Eighty-seven percent of Americans agree that only Americans should vote in our elections.
"Mr. Speaker, it makes me wonder why my friends on the other side of the aisle are always and consistently looking for ways to ensure that illegals can vote in our elections."
"It is almost as though they have an ulterior motive. b 1000 You have to show an ID to board a plane, to buy alcohol, to cash a check."
You have to show an ID to buy cold medicine for God’s sakes.
Why should people not have to verify their citizenship to register to vote?
I say to register because my friend over here keeps pointing out that women in every single congressional district will have to provide proof of their name change in order to vote.
"I ask my colleagues across the aisle to read the bill, page 14."
"If you are registering to vote, there is a process by which the States establish."
"If you are already registered to vote, you are fine."
I am sick and tired and I know women across this country are sick and tired of being talked down to and being insulted repeatedly with the fearmongering tactics of the left.
It is disingenuous for them to stand there and to continue to say that women will not be eligible to vote.
"This is about protecting one of our most sacred rights that we have as Americans, and I am so proud to stand here as a woman, as a married woman, and, again, as the chair of the Republican Women’s Caucus in safeguarding and ensuring the integrity of our elections."
The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Florida."
"The point is, is that Americans around this country are sick and tired of the fear-mongering tactics that they have been subjected to by the left for decades."
We need to ensure the integrity of our elections.
"It has been demanded by the American people, and we are making good on that promise today."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I think my colleagues doth protest too much."
I have read the bill many times.
There is nothing in the bill that allows you to bring a marriage license to prove who you are when you register to vote.
"You will have to do all the things we suggest you will have to do, and that is exactly the problem."
I will also remind my colleague and friend from Florida that in Mrs.
"CAMMACK’s district, an estimated 170,000 women in her congressional district have a different name on their birth certificate than on their current photo ID and that roughly 409,000 residents of Florida’s Third Congressional District lack a passport."
The cost to those individuals: $53.1 million to secure passports.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL), my dear friend and distinguished member of our committee and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Elections of House Administration."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the House Republican’s so-called SAVE Act, the most restrictive voting law to be considered by this body in decades."
The SAVE Act is just the latest in the ongoing assault on our democracy by President Trump and his allies in Congress.
"Instead of working to meet the needs of the American people, House Republicans are busy spreading fear and lies to justify their attempts to disenfranchise millions of eligible voters."
Let’s be clear: It is already against the law for non-Americans to vote.
This bill is a solution in search of a problem.
The SAVE Act would create new barriers to the ballot box for millions of eligible voters.
That includes almost 70 million American women who got married and changed their last name.
"It also includes 140 million Americans without a passport, and it includes Americans with military and Tribal IDs. To be clear, this bill is not about protecting our elections; it is about making it harder for Americans to vote and easier for Republicans to win."
"As elected officials, we should be working to expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it."
"Congress should be considering H.R. 14, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to ensure that every American can freely and fairly vote."
"Mr. Speaker, this is very personal to me."
"I am not only the Representative of America’s civil rights district, but I am also the proud daughter of Selma, Alabama."
It was in my hometown where hundreds of foot soldiers were bludgeoned on a bridge for the equal right of all Americans to vote.
This legislation before us today makes a mockery of their legacy.
"Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BEAN) to speak on the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank very much the chairman for yielding time."
"Mr. Speaker, one citizen, one vote."
"It is the pillar of our democracy and you would think that of all the issues that we debate on this hallowed floor, this is the one."
"This is the one that brings everybody together, the pillar of our democracy, one citizen, one vote."
Everybody is on the same team.
"Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong."
It is amazing that you would be wrong because there are people in this room that think women are incapable of getting an ID.
I think that is an insult to women.
"Mr. Speaker, let me remind you why we are here."
"We are here because this previous administration, the Biden administration, imported 10 to 15 million illegal aliens who have come here and we have evidence that they are participating in our elections."
The next thing you will say is: Did they get Social Security numbers?
The DOGE team just announced millions of illegals now have Social Security numbers.
"It is happening, and it ends today when we vote on the SAVE Act."
I have just heard my colleagues say it is already against the law.
"We don’t need this act, but let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is already against the law for a minor to buy beer, but yet the clerk checks the ID before the purchase is made."

I invite our colleagues to come together.
"There is still time to agree that the pillar of our democracy is one citizen, one vote."
The right answer on the SAVE Act is a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, the gentleman’s comments lead me to the question: Do Republicans believe that every attestation under Federal law is rife for subversion?"
Americans must attest under penalty of perjury that their tax returns contain correct information.
Do Republicans want to end this honor system by requiring Americans to provide even more documentation to the Internal Revenue Service?
"It is a Federal crime to lie on alcohol, tobacco, and firearms Form 4473, the firearms transaction record."
That form is filled out under the same honor system that governs voter registrations.
Are you telling me that Republicans are open to strengthening gun licensing laws in the United States and no longer accept attestation?
"Each of us must submit records to the FEC, attesting under penalty of perjury that our campaign committee reports are accurate."
"Do Republicans now want to provide the American people greater transparency around political spending because if they do, I have a bill they can support, the Freedom to Vote Act."
"I will also suggest to the gentleman, Representative BEAN, that an estimated 170,000 women in his district have a different last name on their birth certificate than is on their current photo ID and roughly 397,000 residents of Florida’s Fourth District do not have a passport."
It would cost them $51.7 million to secure one.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. CONAWAY)."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the SAVE Act."
"While everyday Americans are struggling from the fallout of Trump’s disastrous tariff policies, Republicans are pushing through a bill that strips Americans’ constitutional right to vote, a vote that was hard won and for which many died."
"They claim the SAVE Act is intended to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting, but it is already illegal for them to vote, and it is extremely rare."
"In reality, the SAVE Act makes it harder for Americans, especially women and people of color, to participate in our elections."
"We have seen these tactics before, creating barriers to the ballot box to suppress the vote, and yet Republicans continue to find ways to undermine democracy."
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves: Do you want to stand on the side of voter suppression or do you want to stand on the side of democracy?"
I choose democracy and will vote ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous anti-American bill.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"Mr. Speaker, I am hearing from the other side that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote."
"It is also illegal to evade Border Patrol and cross the border illegally into the United States of America, but enforcement matters."
We can look at what happens when you don’t enforce the law under the Biden administration and what happens when you do enforce the law under the Trump administration.
"I think back to when I went home to my hometown in Janesville, Wisconsin, the other day and I went to buy a sixpack of beer."
"I walked in and the gentlewoman at the desk said: Bryan, good to see you."
"I went back, grabbed a sixpack of beer, came up, and she said: Bryan, I need to see your ID."
I pulled out my ID and handed it to her.
She allowed me to purchase a six-pack of beer.
Am I the only one here that thinks it is absolutely absurd that we protect our beer more than we protect our ballots?
This law allows us to make sure that only U.S. citizens are voting in U.S. elections.
"Mr. Speaker, it is about enforcement of the law."
I ask my colleagues across the aisle: How many noncitizen votes should be okay?
The answer to me and my colleagues on this side of the aisle is zero because every noncitizen that votes in a Federal election in the United States of America cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen.
"As we know in this Chamber, very often House races are close."
One of our Representatives in this Chamber was elected by simply six votes.
"One noncitizen voting in a Federal election in the United States is too many, and the arguments I am hearing from my colleagues on the left is that they are okay with noncitizens voting."
"It is essential that not only do we have the law but that we enforce the law, and the SAVE Act does just that."
"This is my good friend, CHIP ROY, from the State of Texas, the author of the bill, who I have been working with to do just that."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) to speak on the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his strong work and commitment to election integrity and to working with us on this bill, in particular, the SAVE Act."
"He has done an extraordinary job, and I am proud to work with him and work with the rest of my colleagues on it."
"I am also proud to work with my friend, Cleta Mitchell, who had a significant hand in what we are doing here."
"I am quite certain that she is pretty well aware of protecting the right of females to be able to vote, along with my friends STEPHANIE BICE, MARY MILLER, LAUREL LEE, LAUREN BOEBERT, and KAT CAMMACK, all of whom came down to the floor in full support of this legislation because they know the truth."
"They know the truth that the American people know, which is that, as much as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to bring up the DMV, the American people know that the DMV is very good at giving driver’s licenses to illegal aliens because we know it to be true."
We know that there are people who have been indicted for voting illegally.
We know that there are voter rolls with massive numbers of people who are illegally present in the United States.
"We know that the previous administration let in millions of people into the United States, wrongfully and illegally under parole and asylum, blatantly abusing the law to put people in the United States that have no basis for being here, many of whom carried out dangerous acts against American people, killed American citizens, but importantly, have been registering to vote."
That is what has been happening.
"What we understand is, the American people have spoken very clearly that they believe only American citizens should vote in American elections."
There is nothing controversial about that.
There is nothing controversial about saying that you should be able to ensure that only citizens vote.
Let’s be very clear: Federal law has currently been interpreted to prohibit States from being able to check citizenship.
"That is why the State of Arizona, for example, has two systems—one for State and local, one for Federal."
Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.
"The good people of Arizona have two systems in place: They check for citizenship for State and local elections, and they are unable to check for citizenship in Federal elections."
"The point of this bill is to ensure that we guarantee only citizens vote by allowing those States to be able to check, by having systems, Federal systems be open to the States to be able to check, and to require proof of citizenship when you register."
There is nothing complex about that.
"There is nothing more sacred under the Constitution than ensuring that the people are able to have the voice in the election of the people that represent them in Washington and throughout the country. b 1015 Mr. Speaker, once that is undermined, then people lose faith in the very institutions upon which this is built."
"This legislation is designed to restore that faith, to save our elections, and to save election integrity."
"I am proud to have worked on this bill with my friend, the chairman, and with my colleagues on this side of the aisle."
"I would note that five of my Democratic colleagues joined us last summer to vote for this bill, hardly a partisan exercise to say that we should protect the elections of the American people."

"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining."
The gentleman from New York has 7 minutes remaining.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. FIGURES), my friend."
"Mr. Speaker, all of my colleagues today are speaking about this bill, and it is personal to me because I represent Alabama."
I represent the birthplace of the civil rights movement.
I would be remiss not to mention that election integrity was not an issue that my colleagues had been pushing until Donald Trump told them that they should be pushing this issue.
"For me, it is about too many people doing too many things too courageously for me to be able to stand here today."
"There are names like James Reeb, Jimmie Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner."
These are people who died for me to be here today.
"Congressman John Lewis, who most of you served with, died for me to be here today."
"This bill would make it tougher than it has ever been in American history to register to vote at a time when we have the technological ability to be able to verify election eligibility, but we don’t want to do that."
"We want to make it tougher for people to actually get registered to vote, and that is not what we should be doing."
We should be making it easier for people to vote.
"Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining."
The gentleman from Wisconsin has 31⁄2 minutes remaining.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. KILEY), my friend and colleague."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of the SAVE Act to advance the radical proposition that only American citizens should vote in American elections."
"Of course, this isn’t radical at all."
I think the vast majority of Americans would be shocked to learn that it elicits any opposition at all.
"In many States in this country, foremost my own State of California, the administration of our elections is completely out of touch with the rest of the developed world, falling well short of the standards that ought to exist in a modern democratic society."
This measure requiring proof of citizenship in order to vote is a needed corrective.
"I believe, in my State, it will complement other initiatives that we are advancing now to require voter ID and to have a timely vote-counting process in order to restore public confidence in our election process."
"What is at stake is not only election integrity and election security but democratic legitimacy, ensuring that our people have the ability to express themselves fully in our own identity as a State in the country through the democratic process."
I urge passage of this on a bipartisan basis.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. FRIEDMAN)."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member MORELLE for yielding me time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this so-called SAVE Act, a bill that is a modern-day poll tax targeting American women and low-income Americans."
"It bans using driver’s licenses as a voter ID unless they are backed by additional proof of citizenship, a requirement that excludes nearly all driver’s licenses and REAL IDs issued today."
"For women who have changed their names, often through marriage, this means showing a passport or a birth certificate that may not match their legal name."
"That would have meant that my grandmother, who had long since lost her birth certificate, would have been ineligible to vote under this bill."
"In California alone, that would include more than 7 million women."
This would force those women to pay $130 just to get the passport they need to vote.
"With nearly a third of Californians lacking passports, this bill would cost them more than $1.25 billion statewide."
"If you have to pay to vote, that is called a poll tax, plain and simple."
It is also unnecessary red tape for people just trying to cast a ballot.
This is a bill in search of a problem.
We have enough trouble getting American citizens to vote.
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LATIMER), my dear friend."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MORELLE for yielding me the time."
"Mr. Speaker, the American people in my district and in my State have spoken clearly."
"This bill is voter suppression, pure and simple."
It is brought to us under the guise of stopping illegal voting.
"When we analyze voting in Westchester County, where I was the county executive for a million people, we found no appreciable illegal voting."
This is an opportunity for this majority to try to impose their will on the States that they don’t already control.
They want to end mail voter registration in my home State to satisfy other States’ regressive laws.
They want to require people who have voted legally for years to prove their citizenship if they not only change their name but if they move.
A simple move requires them to drive to a county board of elections and prove that they are an American citizen when they have proven that over the course of 20 years or more of voting.
This bill subjects local officials to hefty criminal fines if they register someone outside of these rules.
"This is an expensive unfunded mandate in Westchester, New York City, and all the States involved."
"Mr. Speaker, I was remiss earlier."
"I want to remind my colleague, Mr. ROY, that an estimated 150,000 women in his district have a different name on their birth certificate than on their photo ID, and 336,000 residents of Texas’ 2lst District lack a passport, a cost of $43.7 million to those who would need to get a passport should they choose that."
"Also, I would like to remind my colleague, Representative KILEY, an estimated 135,000 women in his district have a different name, and roughly 268,000 residents of California’s Third District do not have a passport."
The cost to them for getting one is $34.8 million.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), my friend."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Republicans’ voter suppression act."
"I want to give Republicans one chance to actually fulfill the rhetoric that they are spouting to the American people, which is actually giving people the right to vote."
I appreciate efforts to ensure that our elections are safe and free from foreign interference and that only U.S. citizens can vote.
"However, one of my concerns with this bill is, as it is written, it does not allow for mail or online voter registration."
"This bill, let me be perfectly clear, requires hardworking American people who go to work at 8 in the morning and who don’t get off until 5 p.m. to go in person to a voter registration office, to take off work to go in person to register to vote."
That is why I have offered an amendment to have online voter registration.
"There are millions of servicemembers and their families serving our country overseas, individuals with disabilities, and seniors who are unable to vote in person."
Why are we keeping these barriers for eligible citizens when the world is evolving around us?
"We live in modern times, and so many of our lives happen online for daily activities."
We can pay our bills and we can pay our taxes online.
"You can apply for college, a car, a home, and everything else online."
"For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to recommit VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:58 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.017 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1579 April 10, 2025 this bill back to committee."
"If the House rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with my commonsense amendment to this bill."
My amendment would ensure Americans could still register to vote and prove their citizenship online or by mail.
"This is a simple, commonsense amendment, and it would make certain that we can care for the people who can’t get out of their homes and that this Congress is not depriving any eligible citizens of their right to vote."
Republicans are refusing your ability to go and make it easy for citizens to register to vote in this country.
Republicans can now vote to pass this amendment.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
"The SAVE Act is, to put it nicely, the most severe voter suppression bill ever considered at the Federal level."
"Coupled with President Trump’s recent antivoter executive order, the SAVE Act would end the voter registration process for all Americans as they know it."
Republicans have repeatedly failed to present any evidence that noncitizen voting at the Federal level has ever affected the outcome of any election.
"The SAVE Act will make it harder for American citizens to vote—for married women to vote, for servicemembers, students, rural Americans, senior citizens, Native voters, survivors of natural disasters, and survivors of domestic abuse to vote."
"It will make voting more expensive, in fact forcing American families to pay billions of dollars just to register to vote."
Democrats want a country where every American citizen can vote.
"That is why we champion bills like the Freedom to Vote Act, the John R."
"Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the Native American Voting Rights Act, not the SAVE Act."
I fiercely oppose this anti-American bill.
"I urge every one of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to defeat this extremist, antivoter SAVE Act."
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume."
Only U.S. citizens should vote in U.S. elections.
"My colleagues on this side of the aisle believe that only U.S. citizens should vote in U.S. elections, and we should keep it that way."
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle just moments ago said that there is no appreciable illegal voting.
"Well, how much illegal voting should be allowed in the United States of America?"
"In my opinion, no noncitizens should vote in U.S. elections."
We can go down and look at the data.
Illinois had to remove 600 noncitizens from their voter rolls.
"Pennsylvania had to remove 10,000 noncitizens from their voter rolls."
"In Georgia, 1,600 noncitizens attempted to register."
"In our Nation’s Capital, where they allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections, this past November, 388 noncitizens voted here in our Nation’s Capital in municipal elections."
You will hear the argument from my colleagues across the aisle that it is already illegal to vote if you are a noncitizen in a Federal election.
"I tell them, as I said earlier, it is already illegal to evade Border Patrol and to come into this country, but Joe Biden was happy not to enforce the law."
Millions of illegal immigrants have come into the United States of America.
"The National Voter Registration Act, as drafted by this body, if you broke it, you have to fix it."
We have to fix the voting laws.
The National Voter Registration Act requires States to give voter registration materials when an individual comes to get a driver’s license.
"In States that give driver’s licenses to illegal aliens, like the State of Illinois, just to the south of my home State of Wisconsin, they are handed voter registration materials. b 1030 Mr. Speaker, I view that as insane."
We should be making sure that only U.S. citizens are voting in U.S. elections.
You will hear arguments about it is burdensome.
"Mr. Speaker, I think it is absurd that we are protecting beer more than we are protecting ballots."
You have to show a photo ID when you go in to buy a six-pack of beer.
You should have to go in and show that you are a U.S. citizen when you register to vote.
I remind my colleagues that we had this debate in this Chamber last Congress.
Five Democrats joined us in voting for this bill.
"In a few moments, we will be voting, Mr. Speaker."
It will be darn interesting to see how many Democrats have the courage to come across the line and say ‘‘yes’’ to only U.S. citizens should vote in U.S. elections.
My colleagues should support this bill.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
All time for debate has expired.
"Pursuant to House Resolution 294, the previous question is ordered on the bill."
The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.

Mr. LAWLER."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable constituent and community leader Allan Seebach, Sr., of Tappan, New York."
Allan is a lifelong resident of Tappan and a U.S. Navy veteran who served our Nation during the Korean war.
His service didn’t stop when he returned home.
"In fact, it was just getting started."
"He joined the Volunteer Fire Association of Tappan in 1950, and for nearly 75 years, he has been a cornerstone of the department."
Allan served as chief of the Tappan Fire Department from 1965 to 1968 and again from 1972 to 1974.
"He later became fire commissioner, a role he held for 27 years, 13 of them as chairman of the district."
"Allan’s leadership, mentorship, and tireless dedication to the safety and well-being of his neighbors have left a lasting mark, not only on the department, but on the entire Tappan community."
"As one local fire leader put it, Allan Seebach is the Tappan Fire Department."
"I thank Allan for everything he has done for the people of Tappan, of Rockland County, and of New York’s 17th District."
"His legacy of service is the best of who we are, and I am proud to call him a friend. f HONORING BEYOND LEGAL AID ON 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY (Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois."
"Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 10-year anniversary of Beyond Legal Aid, a vital community-driven legal advocacy organization that has spent the last decade advancing justice from the ground up."
They have successfully built a grassroots network of lawyers and advocates to address critical legal needs to close the equity gap in justice.
"Their work is grounded in a fundamental truth, that an injustice to one member of our community is an injustice to all of us."
"Beyond Legal Aid places impacted communities at the center of their advocacy, reshaping what legal support can and should look like."
"Beyond Legal Aid in Chicago has worked for 10 years to inspire and enact change across my district and has represented over 5,000 clients in immigration and housing cases."
"As an ardent supporter of community-driven grassroots activism, I commend Beyond Legal Aid for 10 years of fighting against systemic inequities."
I sincerely appreciate their dedication and look forward to supporting Beyond Legal Aid in building toward a world where justice is not a privilege but a birthright. f b 1130 HONORING HARRY LYNN (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Harry Lynn, of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, a family man, beloved community member, and World War II veteran."
"Sadly, Harry passed away last week at the age of 102."
"Despite an initial draft deferment due to significant visual impairment, Harry enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he became recognized as one of the Army’s top three Morse code operators."
He became a Morse code instructor and rose to the rank of staff sergeant.
"This year, we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory because of the sacrifices of heroes like Harry."
His determination to do his duty despite personal adversity displayed the true Nebraskan spirit to answer the call of service in one of the most challenging times in our Nation’s history.
Harry and each of America’s World War II veterans deserve our deepest gratitude and most sincere thanks.
"On April 2, Harry and his daughter, Sherri, were tragically killed in a car accident."
I extend my condolences to the family members and celebrate the life of this American patriot.
Harry’s memory and example of service will live on in our hearts. f CELEBRATING GATORS’ 2025 NATIONAL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate my Florida Gators, the University of Florida men’s basketball team, for winning the 2025 National Championship."
It is their third title and the first since back-toback Gator wins in 2007.
"In a heart-stopping final, mostly my heart, they erased a 12-point, secondhalf deficit to defeat the amazing Houston Cougars with a score of 65–63."
"Under Coach Golden, they showed the resilience, discipline, and heart that epitomize Gator athletics."
"Walter Clayton, Jr., the tournament MVP, led that charge, proving time and again that he and his teammates rise to the occasion when it matters most."
"Yet, this championship is more than just a trophy."
It is a symbol of U.S. excellence both on and off the court.
It reflects the strength of our State’s public universities and the pride we all share as Floridians.
The Gator Nation is still humming.
"As a proud alum, along with my dad, brother, husband, and all three of my kids, I will say it is great to be a Florida Gator."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all the players and coaches and all the students and alumni who cheered them on."
Our Gator boys stayed hot and brought a title home.
Go Gators. f SUPPORTING PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP FOR VOTERS (Mr. HARRIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HARRIS of North Carolina.
"Mr. Speaker, in America, you can’t drive a car, board a plane, or buy fireworks without an ID proving that you are who you say you are."
"Why are folks allowed to vote, to decide the future of this country, without proving that they are citizens first?"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the House passing the SAVE Act just moments ago."
It is common sense that only American citizens should be able to vote in American elections.
Congressman CHIP ROY’s SAVE Act will close election loopholes by ensuring that every State requires voters to provide proof of citizenship before registering to vote.
"When noncitizens go to the ballot box, the electoral system is compromised and American votes are diluted."
"The American people have the right to determine the future of our country, and we refuse to be disenfranchised by illegal votes."
I was proud to support the SAVE Act when it passed the House today. f CONGRATULATING JONAS ALMERINO (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the remarkable achievement of a teacher from Wilson, North Carolina."
"Mr. Jonas Almerino, a high school science teacher at Sallie B."
"Howard School, has been awarded the Burroughs Wellcome Fund’s 2025 Career Award for STEM Teachers."
"The award honors outstanding educators who are committed to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."
The grant will be used to set up science equipment and living labs in the school’s new high school building and provide essential supplies.
"The award includes $175,000 over 5 years."
"STEM will play a crucial role in the future of education, and Mr. Almerino is proving that North Carolina is leading the way."

"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Ryan Griffin, a devoted father, community leader, and accomplished professional who left an indelible mark on lower Mississippi and beyond."
"Ryan was a man of service, whether through his career in journalism or communications, his leadership in civic organizations like Kiwanis and the United Way, or his unwavering dedication to his hometown."
"From the football field at West Jones High School to the halls of the University of Southern Mississippi, Ryan exemplified leadership, integrity, and a passion for bringing people together."
"Above all, Ryan’s love for his family, his faith, and his community defined his life."
His impact will be felt for generations to come.
"My prayers are with his children, his loved ones, and all who had the privilege of calling him a friend."
"Mr. Speaker, may we honor his legacy and continue his commitment to service and kindness. f REMEMBERING JACK FITZGERALD (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RASKIN."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember my beloved friend and Montgomery County legend, Jack Fitzgerald, who passed away this week at the age of 89."
"He will be sharply missed by friends, family, and customers of the Fitzgerald Auto Malls up and down the East Coast."
"Jack’s life embodied the restless, adventuresome spirit of America and entrepreneurial business at their very best."
"Over the course of his extraordinary life, he built Bethesda Auto from a single storefront in the early 1950s into a massive success, with dealerships across Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Florida."
"An old-fashioned businessman devoted to the community, he was an eloquent champion of customer safety, consumer protection, and employee well-being."
He pioneered the installation of child safety seats before it became an industry standard.
Jack was friends not just with CEOs of auto companies but with Ralph Nader.
"Remarkably, Jack transferred his company to employee stock ownership over the last year before his death."
"His legacy now lives on in his employees and in everybody in Montgomery County, Maryland, who loved him."
"Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting the life of Jack Fitzgerald, who was a pillar of our community and a local hero."
May his memory be a blessing.
RECOGNIZING DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY LORI FRAZIER BEARDEN (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lori Frazier Bearden, a resident of Savannah, Georgia, who will serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Employment and Training Administration, ETA, at the United States Department of Labor."
Ms. Bearden earned her bachelor’s degree in political science from Columbus State University in Georgia and her master’s degree in public administration from Auburn University.
"In this role, Ms. Bearden will assist Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer in executing President Donald Trump’s mission of prioritizing American workers, veterans, and retirees."
"She will work to advance the ETA’s mission of contributing to the more efficient functioning of the U.S. labor market by providing high-quality job training, employment, labor market information, and income maintenance services, primarily through State and local workforce development programs."
Ms. Bearden’s dedication to public service and expertise in navigating complex policy landscapes make her an asset to the Trump administration.
I congratulate Ms. Bearden on this exciting achievement.
We all look forward to watching her succeed and wish her the best in her new role. f HONORING COAST GUARD ADMIRAL LINDA FAGAN (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Linda Fagan, a trailblazer."
Her decades of service have strengthened our Nation and brought pride to the people of Ohio.
"Throughout her distinguished 40-year career, Admiral Fagan broke barriers."
She led with strength of purpose.
"As the first woman to serve as Commandant of the United States Coast Guard and the first woman to lead a branch of our Armed Forces, she made history with integrity and fortitude."
Admiral Fagan’s service spanned all seven continents.
"From the icy waters of the poles to ports around the world, she safeguarded our Nation’s interests with professionalism and resolve."
"Her deep expertise in marine safety is unmatched, and she holds the title of Gold Ancient Trident, the first of that honor and a symbol of enduring leadership in one of the Coast Guard’s most critical missions."
"Yet, patriots must acknowledge with concern the abrupt dismissal of Admiral Fagan just 1 day after a Presidential inauguration, with only 3 hours’ notice."
Actions that politicize our armed services undermine the trust and stability of these institutions.
Admiral Fagan’s legacy is not one of partisanship but patriotism.
Let us honor and thank her for her service.
"Our military remains above political winds, guided, as she was, by our Constitution, principle, high professionalism, and a deep love of country."
I thank Admiral Fagan for her service.
"Now, we have the watch. f CONGRATULATING GIRL SCOUTS OF WESTERN OHIO ON GOLD AWARD (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAYLOR."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio."
These hardworking and dedicated Scouts are agents for positive change in their communities and work every day to create a better world.
"In 2024, 44 Senior and Ambassador Girl Scouts from the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio earned the prestigious Gold Award."
"In pursuit of this distinction, each Scout identified a specific issue close to their hearts and utilized teamwork and collaboration to effect positive change in their community, leaving a lasting impact."
"Carolyn Koch, a graduate of Blanchester High School, created a Build Community Through Theater program to engage youth and help them develop confidence."
"Promoting drama education in her community, Carolyn invested her time and energy in creating a middle school drama camp, free of charge, for fifth to eighth grade students in the Blanchester Local School District."
"The Girl Scouts Promise reads: ‘‘On my honor, I will try to serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout Law.’’ Carolyn and each of the other recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award are the embodiment of this promise."
I also recognize the parents and Scout leaders who supported each Girl Scout on their path to this milestone.
Their support made all the difference.
"I congratulate the Girl Scouts, especially Carolyn."
"Her investment in our community is appreciated, and Ohio can’t wait to see what is in store for her next. f PROTECTING THE PROMISE OF AMERICA (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

"Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to serve as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs."
"Today, I rise to recognize one veteran in particular, my great uncle, Manzo Takahashi."
Uncle Mon served in the legendary 442nd Infantry Battalion and gave his life in service to our Nation on this very day 80 years ago.
"He gave the last full measure of devotion while his family, my grandparents and parents, were incarcerated in camps simply because they were Japanese Americans."
"Uncle Mon’s story is just one of nearly 18,000 Japanese-American soldiers who embodied the motto Go for Broke."
They risked everything for a country that had denied them so much because they believed in the promise of America.
The Trump administration erased the story of the 442nd from the Army’s website and now seeks to gut the care that our veterans have earned.
"To truly honor our veterans, we must defend their legacy, protect their stories, and uphold the Nation that they fought to build."
"Mr. Speaker, that is the debt we owe them. f b 1145 PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS TO VOTE (Mr. MEUSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MEUSER."
"Mr. Speaker, this morning, all 216 of my GOP colleagues, along with just four out of 212 Democrats, passed the SAVE Act, which is a bill that mandates proof of citizenship for those registering to vote."
I think most people think that is already required and mandated.
"Even though it is in the Constitution and Federal law mandates that only citizens can vote, there are States that have systems in place that allow noncitizens to register."
"To address this problem, the SAVE Act also requires States to establish a program to remove noncitizens from their voter rolls."
"Just last month, even though Iowa did what it could to correct this problem, 277 noncitizens were on the voter rolls and 35 of them voted."
"That may not sound consequential, but there are races that are decided by less than that."
The votes against the SAVE Act today were nothing more than to allow noncitizens to vote in the United States of America.
I think that falls into the category of the 80/20 position.
"All I know, Mr. Speaker, is a vote against the SAVE Act today was a vote against American citizens’ voting rights."
HONORING ISAAC SAMUELSON (Ms. GILLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. GILLEN.
"Mr. Speaker, today, I am so proud to honor Isaac Samuelson, a young leader from Long Island and a member of Boy Scout Troop 613 based in West Hempstead."
"Isaac spearheaded a project to preserve over 20 years’ worth of religious texts, prayer books, and educational materials that had just been stashed away somewhere in his synagogue."
"He, along with his family, friends, and Troop 613 members, spent hours organizing materials, ensuring that important religious materials could be preserved and used by future generations."
Isaac exemplifies the values of Boy Scouts and civic responsibility.
He is a role model not just for young people in our community but for all of us.
"Mr. Speaker, I thank Isaac for his leadership in our community."
"I am so proud to be his Representative. f RECOGNIZING TAIWAN AS A TRUSTED LEADER IN FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND TRADE (Mrs."
KIM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs.
"Mr. Speaker, today marks 46 years since the Taiwan Relations Act became law."
This landmark bill has strengthened the partnership with Taiwan and shaped America’s foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region.
"I will recognize that Taiwan is a trusted leader in freedom, democracy, and trade, and is also a needed partner in security against shared threats."
"As chairwoman of the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee, I have worked on bipartisan bills to give Taiwan a rightful seat at the table in international organizations, such as WHO and IMF."
I led the charge to track and ensure efficient delivery of weapons that Taiwan has purchased from the United States.
"This year, I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill to enhance U.S.-Taiwan economic and trade ties."
Our partnership with Taiwan is more important than ever. f MARKETS SENT INTO A TAILSPIN (Mr. SUBRAMANYAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President posted on social media: ‘‘This is a great time to buy.’’ Then, shortly after that, he paused his tariff plan, the very one that sent markets into a tailspin."
"The market bounced back, although it is down again, and the President celebrated in the Oval Office with top financial executives."
"The parents who watched their kids’ college savings accounts get depleted, the retirees who rely on their investments to carry them through their remaining years, and the small business owners, including many in my district, who don’t know how to plan and don’t know how to keep the lights on at this point."
"This wreaked havoc on millions of Americans, and those Americans also deserve to know about what happened and who profited off of it."
Did the financial executives know about what was going to happen?
Who knew and who profited from this ‘‘great time to buy’’ tweet and everything that was leading up to it?
We need a full investigation into what happened and who profited from it.
The American people deserve better. f HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JUDGE MICHAEL J.
KRAMER (Mr. STUTZMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. STUTZMAN.
"Mr. Speaker, today, I somberly rise to recognize the tremendous life and career of the Honorable Judge Michael J."
Judge Kramer was a well-recognized titan of the judicial branch in the State and beyond.
"Prior to his sudden passing last month, he achieved the legendary feat of becoming the longest serving judge in Noble County history."
"His many accomplishments include being named Distinguished Hoosier by former Governor Frank O’Bannon, being named Volunteer of the Year by Drug-Free Indiana, and becoming Advocate of the Year for the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America."
Michael was serving as the chair of Drug-Free Noble County and was a member and former president of the Noble County Bar Association at the time of his passing.
Noble County was lucky to have lived under the unbiased and truth-seeking gavel of Judge Kramer.
He will be sorely missed by his surviving family and the community he loved so much.
"Mr. Speaker, despite his unexpected passing, the institutions he helped form and the community he made safer will continue to honor his memory and legacy."
The world can use more men like Judge Michael Kramer. f CONGRATULATIONS TO THE FREDERICKSBURG NATIONALS (Mr. VINDMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VINDMAN.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Fredericksburg Nationals on winning their firstever Carolina League Championship."
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.033 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1585 April 10, 2025 Under manager Jake Lowery’s leadership, the team made a thrilling lateseason run and delivered a dominant performance to win the championship."
"Standout prospects like Seaver King and Travis Sykora showed incredible talent, while veteran leaders brought unity and heart to the clubhouse."
My team was honored to present a congratulatory letter when joining their recent ring ceremony and celebration.
"This win is not just a triumph for the team; it is a moment of pride for owner Art Silber, his family, and the entire Fredericksburg community."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Fredericksburg Nats on the unforgettable season and championship well earned. f HONORING THE LIVES OF CHRISTOPHER CRAMP AND HIS BELOVED SONS, DAVID AND THOMAS (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the lives of Christopher Cramp and his beloved sons, David and Thomas, of Bristol Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a father and two sons bound by an unshakable love, and now mourned in the wake of an unfathomable tragedy."
"Mr. Speaker, Chris Cramp was a man who chose compassion not as an occasional act but as a daily calling."
"Across every corner of our community, he was known not only for what he did but for how he did it."
"With an unwavering commitment to lifting up those most in need, he was, in every sense of the word, a guardian of the vulnerable."
"To the homeless, to those struggling with mental health challenges, Chris was a lifeline."
He met people in their lowest moments and helped them chart a path back to hope and dignity.
"Even in his final moments as Thomas struggled, Chris and his son, David, did what they have always done: They responded with love."
"In their courageous attempt to save him, they gave their own lives, a sacrifice that speaks to the very core of who they are as human beings."
"Mr. Speaker, the magnitude of this loss has reverberated throughout Bristol Borough and our entire Bucks County community and far beyond."
"May we remember Chris for how he lived with open hands, an open heart, and a tireless devotion to the forgotten and to the unseen."
"Today, Mr. Speaker, let us lift up the Cramp family in our prayers and let us commit to carrying forward Chris’ legacy: to serve with compassion, to love without condition, and to never turn away from those who need us most."
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ANNE EVANS (Mr. VARGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VARGAS.
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Anne Evans, who was called home on February 12."
There are some people so important and central to a city and a community that their lives become intertwined.
Anne Evans’ life and the life of San Diego for the last 60 years were magnificently intertwined.
"Anne was America’s finest lady, and she made San Diego America’s Finest City."
"Every major advancement in the last 60 years that made San Diego great, from developing our beloved Mission Bay to redeveloping our urban core, you could find Anne right in the middle of it."
"She was fearless, brilliant, and a trailblazer, always anxious to make things better for everyone."
This is why she became a leading philanthropist and gave back generously to the city she loved and taught her children to do the same.
"Mr. Speaker, the city of San Diego’s heart is broken with the passing of Anne."
We would have never become America’s Finest City without her.
"I pray for her family, her greatest legacy to our city, and I thank God for the life of Anne Evans, the guardian of San Diego."
"Rest in peace, Anne Evans, and job well done. f HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RICHARD LOCKAMY (Mr. KNOTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KNOTT."
"Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to wish the happiest of birthdays to my dear friend and brother in Christ Richard Lockamy."
I have known Richard for as long as I can remember.
"With age, I admire, respect, and appreciate the man Richard is, and that admiration is growing with every day."
"Briefly, Richard grew up in Benson, North Carolina, the oldest of four."
"He attended Shaw University, followed by North Carolina State University, where he received a graduate degree in mathematics."
"He married Lena Lockamy, with whom he shared 48 wonderful years of marriage before Lena passed into her eternal heavenly home nearly 5 years ago."
"Richard and Lena had one son, Marcus, who, in his own right, is now a wonderful man."
"Professionally, Richard has worked at some of the world’s leading companies, and for decades he has taught at the high school and collegiate level."
"Despite his many professional accomplishments, what truly sets Richard apart in my life and in the lives of many others is his faithful service to his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
"With each day and every encounter, Richard’s witness is as apparent as it is infectious."
I saw this personally in the Raleigh men’s class of Bible Study Fellowship where for nearly 40 years Richard met with dozens of men each week.
"Mr. Speaker, I wish Richard a happy birthday. f VOTER SUPPRESSION BILL CLOAKED IN LIES ABOUT ELECTION INTEGRITY (Ms. DEXTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. DEXTER."
"Mr. Speaker, today, House Republicans betrayed their mothers, their sisters, their daughters, and every woman in their life."
"The so-called SAVE Act is an antiwoman, antidemocracy, voter suppression bill cloaked in lies about election integrity."
"With this vote, House Republicans have jeopardized access to the ballot box for nearly 70 million American women."
That isn’t just a number; it is personal.
It is the working mom in Sandy who can’t afford to take time off work to go get paperwork.
It is the woman in Portland whose name no longer matches her birth certificate and doesn’t have $160 for a passport.
"In the year 2025, I cannot believe I have to come to the House floor to argue for a woman’s right to vote, but I will fight this Republican effort to disempower women today and every single day if I need to."
"As a mother, I will not allow this country to continue to strip our daughters of their rights."
We cannot force them to grow up in a world where they have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.
I call on my Senate colleagues to show courage and defeat this despicable bill. f THIS COUNTRY HAS IMMIGRATION LAWS (Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GROTHMAN.
"Mr. Speaker, during a committee hearing I attended yesterday, immigration was a topic that was brought up and it seemed apparent to me that the party on the other side of the aisle didn’t understand why we have immigration laws."
"First of all, it is a complete insult to the over 800,000 people who are sworn in as new citizens in this country annually."
"Secondly, we have to make sure the next generation of Americans here think like Americans and fit in our culture, which means they are lawabiding."
"Just in general, the idea of having a million people breaking the law to come here, saying they need asylum when they don’t, means they are not going to fit in with our culture."
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.035 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1586 April 10, 2025 Finally, I will share a word from Mark Reihl, back from my State legislative days, of the carpenters union."
"Again and again, he would come into my office saying that his guys, his union carpenters, were being undercut by people coming here illegally, and he demanded that we crack down on that."
Illegal immigration drives down wages of Americans who are already here.
"We heard that yesterday as the Democrats were claiming that if you kicked out the illegals the cost of things will go up, as they will. f b 1200 OPPOSING LEGISLATIVE VOTER SUPPRESSION (Ms. ANSARI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ANSARI."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in firm opposition to the Republican passage of the so-called SAVE Act, an act of legislative voter suppression that will make it much harder for most people to vote, the cornerstone of our democracy."
"This bill, which just passed the Republican House, is designed to combat a nonexistent problem."
Noncitizens are already not allowed to vote under Federal law.
"Instances of fraudulent, noncitizen voting are exceedingly rare."
You are literally more likely to get struck by lightning than encounter noncitizen voting.
"To address this made-up problem, Republicans have passed a draconian bill that would make it extremely difficult and costly for servicemembers, married women, and disadvantaged Americans to register to vote."
In most cases it requires a person to present their birth certificate matching a current ID.
There are no exceptions for the 70 million American women who changed their married name.
"This bill also mandates in-person visits to register to vote, disenfranchising potentially tens of thousands of deployed servicemembers, as well as Native Americans in rural areas like northern Arizona."
This is a shocking act of voter suppression. f REPUBLICANS’ BUDGET PLAN PASSAGE (Mr. LATIMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LATIMER.
"Mr. Speaker, House Republicans just passed their budget plan, President Trump’s big, beautiful bill, again."
The first version didn’t cut enough from critical programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
"This budget is a direct attack on the working and middle classes, all while handing more than $7 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires."
"Over 196,000 residents in my district are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, including 73,000 children and 27,000 seniors in one district."
"Approximately 74,000 people who count on SNAP may not be able to put food on the table."
"People who are covered through the Affordable Care Act will see premiums rise by an average of almost $3,000 a year."
This is what President Trump called beautiful?
"These cuts, coupled with the President’s thoughtless tariff policies, will make life more expensive for our neighbors."
We are making a beeline to a MAGA recession and perhaps a MAGA depression.
Stealing from the lower and middle classes to benefit the wealthiest is un-American. f WHO WE ARE FIGHTING FOR (Ms. STANSBURY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. STANSBURY.
"Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment today to share a story of why we are fighting and who we are fighting for."
"Every day this administration claims they are trying to make America healthy again, and yet everything they are doing seems to indicate that they are trying to make us sicker again."
"They have fired 10,000 HHS health professionals."
"On this floor this week, the GOP passed a reconciliation package that would cut Medicaid by billions of dollars."
Every day my constituents ask how can this cruel agenda continue?
"Yesterday, I met with Rochelle Tittmann, a mom of four, who was diagnosed with cancer when she was 29 weeks pregnant 8 years ago."
"By the grace of God, her family, and the medical advancements made possible by the HHS, by the National Institutes of Health, by the CDC, she is here today, and her youngest daughter, Rae, is in the second grade."
These are the people we are fighting for.
"This is why we are fighting back, and this is why we oppose this cruel agenda. f COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Speaker of the House of Representatives: WASHINGTON, DC, April 10, 2025."
"I hereby designate the period from Thursday, April 10, 2025, through Sunday, April 27, 2025, as a ‘‘district work period’’ under clause 13 of Rule I."
"MIKE JOHNSON, Speaker of the House of Representatives. f PROTECTING THE AMERICAN DREAM (Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2025, Mr. GREEN of Texas was recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.) Mr. GREEN of Texas."
"Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise today to initially extend greetings to all, especially those who are traveling over this season of resurrection."
In my church—I am a Christian—we commemorate and celebrate Easter.
"I want to let everyone know that I appreciate those who do, and to those who do not, I understand."
"I also give a special expression of gratitude and thanks to the thousands of persons who have literally called my office, sent cards, greeted me along life’s way, to give me a pep talk, or to simply say to me: We appreciate what you are doing."
"It means a lot to me to have people that I do not know, many of whom I will never meet and greet, to simply say to me: We want you to continue to do what you are doing."
"As you know, Mr. Speaker, I have been censured."
I was censured but not silenced.
I was censured but not silenced.
I am here today because I was censured but not silenced.
"Today, as a person who still speaks truth to power, I also speak truth about power."
Speaking truth to power is not as difficult as it is to speak truth about power.
"To speak truth to power, you but only have to go to power and say: There is a problem, and you and I can solve it."
That is speaking truth to power.
"When you speak truth about power, you go to power and say: There is a problem, and you are it."
I speak truth about power and to power.
"Today, I am going to speak truth to power as it relates to the President’s tariffs."
"One has to ponder why the President of the United States of America would put so much emphasis on these tariffs, emphasizing the tariffs for many years, as I am told, but put emphasis on the tariffs to the extent that he nearly drove the economy into a ditch, a colloquial way of saying driving the economy into an area wherein it would suffer greatly."
The President put a lot of emphasis on this.
He was just obsessed with the tariffs.
We have to ask ourselves why was he obsessed with the tariffs.
"I am going to answer this question, and I am going to answer this question as it relates to the President’s obsession and how it will impact you."
"It is important for you to understand how this obsession would impact you, how it would impact billionaires, how it would impact your life."
I will answer the question how it will impact you.
It is important for me to call to your attention that the President has a book that you are familiar with.
"It is styled ‘‘The Art of the Deal.’’ Well, I introduce you to the President’s art of the steal."
A steal can be an underhanded way of acquiring something.
This is how the art of the steal works.
"The President, with his tariffs, VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.037 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1587 April 10, 2025 will continue—at one point it was going to be unimaginable, but he has reduced it."
There is a 10 percent tariff.
This tariff is collected at the point of entry into the United States of goods that an importer desires to purvey in this country.
"He wants to sell it, she wants to sell it, or they want to sell it."
"They want to sell these goods, so they have to pay this tariff."
This tariff has to be paid that the President would add to the goods.
"Let’s say you have something that costs $40,000 coming into the country, a tariff of 10 percent, so that is going to give you an additional $4,000."
"This additional $4,000 is collected at the point of entry, and the person importing has to pay the tariff."
This is the Trump tariff tax at this point.
"When that tariff is paid, that money goes into the Treasury of the United States of America, the same place that your tax dollars will go, into the Treasury of the United States of America."
The tariff is collected at the port of entry.
"Let’s say $4,000 on a $40,000 item—it is a 10 percent tariff— and when it is collected, it goes again, important to remember, into the Treasury."
"Now, that person who imports and has this additional tax now to deal with will do what you will see when you buy something and you are in a State that has a sales tax."
You will see that the item costs X amount of dollars.
"If it is something that costs $40,000 and there is a 10 percent sales tax, then you will see that there is a tax on there, a sales tax of 10 percent, or $4,000."
"Well, here is where the stealth comes in."
Here is where the art of the steal begins.
"When the person sells that $40,000 item and has to add that additional $4,000 to it, that person becomes somewhat of a tax collector for the Trump tariff-tax steal."
"That person who purchased this item, brought it into the country, paid $40,000 for it, and then had to pay $4,000 more, making it $44,000, adds that $4,000 to the product when you buy it."
The unfortunate thing is that it is not done the way a sales tax is done.
It is not noted that you are paying it.
"You pay it because it is a part of buying the product, but there is nothing that will say this is the Trump tarifftax steal."
It is a very stealthy way of doing business.
"Most people don’t realize that they are paying this tariff, this tax, this steal, if you will."
"They do, but, again, we really haven’t gotten to the essence of what is important here."
"That money, that $4,000 that was paid at the point of entry, is now collected from you because the person who is selling, purveying, does not want to pay that because they are operating possibly on a thin profit margin."
"They already have an overhead that they have to consider, so you pay it."
"Now it goes into the Treasury, and here is where it gets really stealthy."
"The steal gets stealthy because at some point, the President is desiring to say that he gave you a tax break, that you got a tax break from the President."
"That tax break that you think you are getting or may get and the billionaires will get, that is the money that came out of your pocket."
The President was desiring to get this huge tariff because that would be more money in the coffer coming out of your pocket so that it could then be— some of it—you don’t get back dollar for dollar—you might get some of it back.
You may not get any depending on your tax circumstance.
You may not get any. b 1215 This is a stealthy way of doing business.
"This is why it is the art of the steal that has been developed by this President, so that he can take money out of your pocket, put it into the Treasury, and then say later on: You now have a tax break."
I think that people who understand this will understand why tariffs are not always a great benefit to you.
"They can be a benefit in some circumstances, but remember, the President was putting a tariff on some 90-plus countries."
He was putting a tariff on any and every country that he could find a means by which he could tax with a tariff.
"Some places didn’t have people to actually tax with a tariff, just animal life, but he was desperate because he wants to get money into the coffer, the Treasury of the United States of America, so that he can then say to you: You have now a tax break."
"Some of you may—billionaires will— have a tax break, but it is really money out of your pocket that is being returned to you in a diminished fashion."
This is the art of the steal as is being perfected by our President.
"Our President understands also that there are other ways to get money into the coffer, the Treasury."
"You can get money into the Treasury by simply having Medicare or Medicaid—have some cuts into these two programs, these two healthcare programs."
This can be done because there has been an indication in this House that some $880 billion will be cut or should be cut or attempted to be cut—I am going to fight it—from the committee that has jurisdiction over Medicaid and Medicare.
You can’t cut $880 billion out of the appropriations that will emanate from that committee without cutting into Medicaid or Medicare.
"Well, when that is done, that money goes into the Treasury."
"Now, you add the stealth tax, which was a tariff, and you add the money that you are saving now by putting people who need healthcare in harm’s way as it relates to their healthcare, put that money in."
"When I say people who need it, I am talking about people who have longterm illnesses and seniors, dual-eligible persons who may qualify for Medicaid and Medicare, so they need these longterm hospitalization programs available to them."
We are talking about the approximately 40 percent of children in this country who benefit from Medicaid at some point in their lives.
These cuts that would impact children and seniors would then go into the coffer.
"Again, add this to the stealth tariff tax, and you have more money that you can now pass back to people who are going to get a break and say here is what the government is sending you by way of cutting taxes and giving you additional money."
"Friends, I conclude that this is a very stealthy way of doing business when people don’t always understand."
"I believe that if people truly understand how the President is amassing this tax break for billionaires, I think they are going to be exceedingly upset."
There are many ways to express how upset you are.
You can do this always peacefully.
Others will do it at the polls.
"A good many of my colleagues who are participating as persons who are aiding and abetting, if you will, many of them will find, as they are finding out currently, that they are going to be received in less than a very warm way when they find themselves having townhall meetings."
That is why many of them are not having their townhall meetings.
They are going to experience it also when we have an election because people aren’t going to forget this.
"They are not going to forget how the President desperately tried to tax them so that he could then return money, some to them if they were qualified but much to billionaires who would qualify."
"This is, in my opinion, a shameful and disgraceful way for the President to tell people that they are going to get a tax break when it is really their money that is being returned to them by way of this tariff."
"I would also remind people that as we move forward, I have indicated that the filing of Articles of Impeachment is imminent."
We are currently in a countdown to impeachment.
"Now, those who know me know that I wouldn’t say this if I were not going to move on with it, and I am."
We will have Articles of Impeachment filed.
I cannot tell you what the vote will be.
There are some who would say you shouldn’t file the Articles of Impeachment if you can’t win.
"No, you need to know where people stand."
I heard a Member just yesterday indicate that we need to have a certain thing brought before the House to understand where people are.
"It is not unusual for us to have votes to find out where people are on certain issues, and this is no exception."
"The first Articles of Impeachment may not succeed, and the second may VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.039 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1588 April 10, 2025 not succeed, but having laid the foundation for the President’s impeachment in the past, I know that impeachment can succeed."
"I also know that should Democrats reclaim the House and the Senate by margins that are sufficient to not only impeach but to convict, I believe that the President can be removed from office."
He talks of having another term.
"Well, Mr. President, you are not going to have another term."
That is not going to happen.
"I know that you have incited persons to come to the Capitol, the citadel of democracy, and engage in an insurrection."
"I don’t know what you have up your sleeve, but I do know that we will prevent you from having a third term, and the best way to do it is to not have you finish this term."
The best way to do this is to have you impeached and convicted and removed from office.
"I am telling you, it can be done."
The law says it can be done.
We but only have to have the will to do it.
The will is what is necessary to implement the way to an impeachment and a removal of Donald John Trump as President of the United States of America.
"It would be the appropriate thing because he is unfit to be President, unfit to enforce the laws of the land in such a way as to bring honor to the process—unfit."
"When you consistently, repeatedly flout the laws, flout the notion of due process, when you have agents of the State approach a female and approach her with persons who would surround her, and then pull up a mask, and then take her away, all in plainclothes, masks, I don’t believe that the American people want to see that kind of episode take place in this country."
It looks like we have secret police.
"America is not a country with secret police that come and take you away, away from your home to some distant State where you are not known, where you don’t have resources, and they don’t give you any due process."
"The President is destroying the lawful, judicious processes that we have enjoyed."
He is chipping away at them.
"If the President can do it for a person who is here for whatever reasons, the President can do it to any one of us, especially when the President believes that you don’t have to allow a person to say: ‘‘Hey, you have the wrong person."
"I didn’t do that.’’ It doesn’t matter because the President believes that he has the sole authority, by and through his agents, to determine who can stay and who must leave."
"Unfortunately, someone who should be here is not here as a result of the President’s behavior."
The President is harmful to the processes that we have enjoyed in this country.
He is unfit to be President.
He is also unfit because he disrespects the judiciary.
"When he loses a case, it is always the judge’s fault."
"What is amazing to me is that I have colleagues who are buying into that, that it is the judge’s fault."
Let’s impeach the judge because it is the judge’s fault.
"When we start this process of having the person who holds the highest office in the land continually say that judges are not fair when they are dealing with him and things that he would have done, when we allow that, we are now sending a signal to the rest of society that the judges are the reason why we are not succeeding, the reason why we can’t have whatever it is that we want and can’t acquire, and we have to take it to court."
"At some point, people will have a disrespect for the law and the process that will cause others to disrespect the country."
"People invest in this country because they know that we have a good judiciary, that it is a process that has been in place and that will be honored."
They invest in this country also because they know that your money is safe here.
"You invest in our bills, our bonds."
"We have stability except when you do as the President has just done, and that is tariff some 90 countries and do it in such a way as to cause people to start to equivocate when it comes to our bonds, our notes."
"When that happens, you can see how the President backs off."
"He understood finally, at last, that he was making a terrible mistake, and he backed off."
"He has extended what he calls a 90-day pause, but I don’t think he is going to go back to where he was."
Even he understands that he was making a serious mistake.
"Here is the problem with that mistake: He has hurt the brand, the American brand."
He has hurt the image of the country.
He has put the country in a position such that people may no longer think that this is the safest place for their investment dollars.
They may not want to buy our bonds as readily.
"If they don’t buy them readily, that would then make it difficult for us to sell them to pay bills."
The President is hurting the image of the United States of America.
We are now seen as a country that doesn’t honor its word.
The President negotiated a trade deal with Canada and Mexico; he breaks the trade deal.
The President says that he wants Canada to be the 51st State; Canada is not about to become the 51st State.
"I will be quite candid with you, I admire the way the Canadians have made it perfectly clear to the President that this won’t happen."
Someone has to stand up to him.
He wants to make Gaza a resort.
The President has to understand that he is not a king.
"He has awesome power, but he doesn’t have the power to just go around people and take what he wants."
"He doesn’t have that kind of power, and we can’t let him have that kind of power. b 1230 Mr. Speaker, it is important for us to move to impeachment because impeachment is the means by which a reckless, ruthless President can be brought into check."
This is the balance that we have.
"When all else fails, when the Congress majority refuses to act, and when he disregards the orders of the court, impeachment is still available."
"Mr. Speaker, I intend to bring Articles of Impeachment."
I don’t know what the vote would be.
"My guess is that you are not going to get the vote required, but you will get the opportunity to see who believes in what we have said."
We said that the President was a detriment to democracy.
We talked about how he would harm the country if he got back into office.
Let’s find out if we meant that.
One of the ways we will find out is with Articles of Impeachment.
"Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve my country."
I am proud to be an American.
"I want to protect what this country stands for in a positive way, the positive image that our country has had."
"I am trying to change the negative image to a positive, but I want to protect that."
It means something to me to be an American.
"Mr. Speaker, I want this country to be the one that people look up to, as opposed to frowned upon."
Many do now because of the way our President behaves.
"Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that I am censured but not silent, and I yield back the balance of my time."
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HARRIGAN).
"Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f HIGHLIGHTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2025, Mr. KILEY of California was recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.) Mr. KILEY of California."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight ten ways in which the State of California is currently under Federal investigation."
"In particular, the Newsom administration is under Federal investigation."
"The New York Times recently ran a story on this topic with the headline, ‘‘Trump Takes Aim at California Six Times in 24 Hours.’’ The question was asked: Why is the administration targeting California?"
They call it a multipronged assault on California that has begun in earnest.
That is actually the wrong question.
Why the administration is targeting California is the wrong question.
The appropriate question is: Why is California so flagrantly violating Federal law in so many different ways?
"In the article, the junior Senator in our State, ADAM SCHIFF, is quoted as VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.040 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1589 April 10, 2025 saying: ‘‘The President had a ‘partisan vendetta against California.’’’ Senator SCHIFF says that he is ‘‘continuing to weaponize the Federal Government against the one in ten Americans.’’ Of course, that is not it at all."
Protecting the civil rights of Californians is not weaponizing the Federal Government.
It what is the Federal Government is supposed to do and what it is required to do under established law.
What Senator SCHIFF and others are so upset about is that they are used to one-party rule in California being absolutely unchecked.
They are used to radicalism and having absolutely no counterweight.
They are used to Governor Newsom.
His only motivation is his own political self-promotion.
"He has a supermajority legislature and other statewide-elected officials that simply go along with whatever he says or does, regardless of how much damage it does to our State and regardless of how clearly it violates Federal law."
"When The New York Times asked my opinion for this article, I said: ‘‘Extreme policies and unchecked oneparty rule have lowered the quality of life across our State."
All Californians will benefit from greater accountability.
We need balance and common sense.’’ INVESTIGATION INTO MALE ATHLETES PARTICIPATION IN GIRLS’ AND WOMEN’S SPORTS Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, I will discuss today the ten ways in which Federal investigations are restoring that sense of balance and common sense and assuring compliance with the law."
Number one is on the issue of men in women’s sports.
The State has continued to be defiant.
"Recently, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced a direct investigation into the California Interscholastic Federation because of its refusal to follow antidiscrimination laws related to girls and women’s sports."
This includes the possibility of allowing male athletes to compete in women’s sports and use women’s intimate facilities.
Governor Newsom has received a letter from U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.
The letter warns the Governor that California could lose Federal funds if the State continues allowing transgender athletes to play in girls’ and women’s sports.
Secretary of Education McMahon wrote: ‘‘I am officially asking you to inform this Department whether you will remind schools in California to comply with Federal law by protecting sex-separated spaces and activities.’’ She also wrote: ‘‘Allowing participation in sex-separated activities based on ‘gender identity’ places schools at risk of Title IX violations and loss of Federal funding.
"As Governor, you have a duty to inform California school districts of this risk.’’ Interestingly enough, Governor Newsom actually recently stated that he believes it is unfair for the State to allow men to compete in women’s sports."
"Yet, he has taken absolutely no action to stop this unlawful practice."
INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, the second ongoing investigation relates to California’s policy of forcing school districts and schools to keep secrets from parents about their own children."
"The U.S. Department of Education’s Student Privacy Policy Office has launched an investigation into the California Department of Education for alleged violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, FERPA, which gives parents the right to access their children’s educational data."
It is alleged the California Department of Education has abdicated the responsibilities FERPA imposes because of a new California State law that prohibits school personnel from disclosing a child’s gender identity to that child’s parents.
What happened in California is there are a number of school districts that have said that they are simply going to hide this information from parents.
They will not tell parents if their child changes their name or pronouns or anything like that.
There are other districts that say that this is not right.
We actually want to make sure we are being open and transparent with parents.
"They passed their own policy, saying, no, our policy is that we believe that parents have a right to know this."
What the State then did is they started suing these districts.
"They tried to get legal judgments against them, saying they were required under law to lie to parents about their children."
"Fortunately, those lawsuits are being rejected."
"The State legislature then followed up with a statewide law, saying that it is now the policy of the State that they are not allowed to communicate this information with parents."
The school districts are not allowed to have any policy that allows them to communicate this information with parents.
"Mr. Speaker, think about the absurdity of this."
"In California, teachers are forced to use one name and one set of pronouns with a student in class."
"Then their parents come in for a conference, and they are supposed to switch names and switch pronouns and doctor their assignments and the names written on them."
This has actually been done in documented cases in California.
"Thankfully, this Federal law of protecting the privacy right of students and the right of parents to know this information is on the books."
"Accordingly, the Department of Education has launched a Federal investigation."
INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, the third ongoing investigation relates to the issue of racial discrimination in California higher education."
The Department of Justice under Attorney General Bondi is investigating several California universities to assess compliance with the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions.
"This is notable because not only is this now the supreme law of the land, per the recent Supreme Court decision, that there must be equal access but it is also overwhelmingly the expressed will of California voters."
"Just a few years ago, in 2020, the supermajority legislature tried to repeal an existing State constitutional provision that forbade racial discrimination in college admissions."
They put it directly on the ballot.
"By a supermajority, they passed a measure to put it on the ballot."
The people of California said no.
"Despite the fact the campaign for this initiative had a massive 10–1 spending advantage, the people of California voted 57 percent to 43 percent to say, no, we want equality under law to continue to be the policy of our State."
This investigation by Attorney General Bondi is not only about assuring compliance with Federal law but it is also going to protect the clearly expressed will of the people of California.
INVESTIGATION RELATING TO THE CRISIS OF ANTI-SEMITISM AT UNIVERSITIES Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, the fourth investigation relates to the crisis of anti-Semitism at our universities."
The Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism has announced that the Department of Justice has opened a civil pattern or practice investigation into the University of California under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
"The investigation will assess whether the University of California has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race, religion, and national origin against its professors, staff, and other employees by allowing an anti-Semitic hostile work environment to exist on its campuses."
"Attorney General Bondi said: ‘‘This Department of Justice will always defend Jewish Americans, protect civil rights, and leverage our resources to eradicate institutional anti-Semitism in our Nation’s universities.’’ We have seen over the last 11⁄2 years or so absolutely abhorrent, outright anti-Semitism at many universities throughout the country, including at California universities, which our Committee on Education and the Workforce did a lot of work to expose through a number of hearings."
"While there have been some positive reforms that have occurred on some campuses, there are still many ongoing and very severe problems."
These issues are aided and abetted in a lot of cases by university faculty and administrations.
This is an investigation into the full gambit of that activity.
"Then there is a related set of investigations that are looking at the extent to which students who are here, international students, are actually working to advance not only anti-Semitic but pro-Hamas activity."
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.042 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1590 April 10, 2025 Related to all of these anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses, we saw illegal activity with encampments that violated the law, violated university policies, and violated the civil rights of other students."
"We saw buildings being taken over, and we have seen connections between these activities and the agenda of Hamas and groups affiliated with Hamas."
"Recently, the administration has revoked about 100 student visas at universities across California, including the University of California, Berkeley, which is part of a broader assessment of individuals who are involved in activities deemed contrary to U.S. interests."
"This is actually a small number—100 out of 140,000 international students— that are in California."
We do know that there are people who are here and not from this country.
"They have participated in these illegal activities because, as the President’s order cites, Federal law bars noncitizens from being in the U.S. if they support terrorism."
Any connection with pro-Hamas activity falls under the purview of those statutes.
"Indeed, the executive order from the White House quotes the President as saying that his intention is to deport Hamas sympathizers and revoke student visas."
"In a similar vein, UCLA been sued in Federal court in a case alleging that it enabled protesters at an encampment to block Jewish students from accessing certain campus pathways."
"To the extent that folks who are here on a visa were involved in that sort of illegal, pro-terrorist activity, the administration is doing an assessment to take appropriate action."
INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL ILLEGAL POLICIES RELATING TO CALIFORNIA’S HIGH-SPEED RAIL Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, the sixth investigation against some of the insane and potentially illegal policies in California relates to high-speed rail which is the biggest public infrastructure failure in United States history."
I was at Union Station in L.A. a couple of weeks ago.
We were with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
He announced this investigation specifically into the Federal money that has gone into high-speed rail. b 1245 The review that we launched on that day will help determine whether roughly $4 billion in taxpayer money should remain committed to the project to build high-speed rail in the California Central Valley between Merced and Bakersfield.
"I have also requested an investigation by the FBI into how exactly it is that California has so far spent some $17 billion on this project, which was approved in 2008."
"We are talking over 15 years, and it has yet to lay any track."
"At this point, even The New York Times has said that the project isn’t going to be completed this century at the current pace."
The overall cost has ballooned over $130 billion.
That is more than $100 billion more than it was supposed to have been.
"The whole thing was supposed to be completed by now, per the initial projections, but at this point, even the first segment from Bakersfield to Merced, a very modest segment, they are saying isn’t even going to be completed by 2033."
"Indeed, just last week, there was a report from the nonpartisan legislative analyst that there is another $9 billion funding gap, and they are continuing to rely on Federal funding."
"This is an investigation that is ongoing, and I fully expect it will result in those funds being clawed back and hopefully then used on infrastructure projects in California that will actually serve to move people and goods, create jobs that have positive economic value, and actually be helpful in improving the quality of life for folks in our State."
The seventh ongoing investigation relates to California’s cap-and-trade program.
An executive order from the President has directed Attorney General Bondi to identify State and local acts that may be unconstitutional or preempted by Federal law.
"It singles out California’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and then has companies buy and sell credits."
"As the order says, California punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon that businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to trade carbon credit to meet California’s radical requirements."
What is the result of this?
"Even as we have seen gas prices that have gotten much lower across the entire country, Californians continue to pay astronomical prices when they fill up their cars."
"Indeed, California is now some $1.60 above the national average."
"We have the highest gas prices in the country, higher than even Hawaii."
"The major cause of that is the State’s taxes and regulations and other requirements, foremost among them being this cap-and-trade program, which adds substantially to the price of each gallon of gas."
The eighth ongoing investigation relates to the homelessness crisis in California.
California is the national leader in homelessness.
"We have roughly one-half of the unsheltered homeless in the entire country, despite spending absolutely staggering amounts of money."
"Indeed, over the course of the last 5 years, we have seen $24 billion spent on homelessness, and homelessness has continued to go up significantly."
A recent audit actually found that the State has lost track of the money and can’t even tell us where it went or what outcomes it has produced.
"Now, the new United States Attorney for the Central District of California, Bill Essayli, has announced the formation of a homelessness, fraud, and corruption task force, which will investigate fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption involving funds allocated toward the eradication of homelessness within the seven-county jurisdiction of the Central District of California."
"The task force will be comprised of Federal prosecutors from the major fraud section, the public corruption and civil rights section, and the civil division’s civil fraud section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office."
"It will specifically look into what is going on in Los Angeles, where recently a court-ordered audit found that homelessness services provided by the city and county were ‘‘disjointed’’ and contained ‘‘poor data quality and integration.’’ There is a lot of Federal money at stake and at issue, by the way."
"During COVID, the Federal Government sent $100 million in emergency aid to L.A. County to address homelessness, and last month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded more than $200 million to address homelessness in L.A. Now, there is a Federal investigation ongoing led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office into exactly what has happened to all of this money."
The ninth ongoing investigation relates to concealed carry.
"As part of a broader review of restrictive firearmsrelated laws in California and other States, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division has announced an investigation into the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to determine whether it is engaging in a pattern or practice of depriving ordinary, lawabiding Californians of their Second Amendment rights."
"The release from the Attorney General’s Office notes that a recent Federal court decision found that the law and facts were clearly in favor of two private plaintiffs who challenged the lengthy, 18-month delays that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department had imposed when processing their concealed handgun license applications and that the Civil Rights Division has reason to believe that those two plaintiffs are not the only ones in this county of some 8 million people experiencing long delays that are unduly burdening or effectively denying the Second Amendment rights of the people of Los Angeles."
The release from the Attorney General goes on to note the ways in which the Second Amendment rights of Californians have been unduly burdened in countless ways.
They call California a particularly egregious offender.
"In response to recent Supreme Court caselaw, California enacted new legislation to further restrict the ability of ordinary, law-abiding Californians to keep and bear arms."
"Many California localities appear to be imposing additional burdens beyond those required by California State law, including by subjecting ordinary, lawabiding Californians to expensive fees VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.043 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1591 April 10, 2025 and lengthy wait times associated with applications for concealed handgun licenses."
"Now, there will be some counterweight to these measures that are restricting the rights of Californians."
"In fact, there was even a recent proposal in the legislature that went to the very core of the Second Amendment that would have said that you are no longer allowed to defend yourself against an intruder who breaks into your own home."
"Luckily, that bill was defeated, Mr. Speaker, but it just shows you how far California has gone from what is protected by the Constitution."
"Finally, of course, there is ongoing Federal action, this being the 10th Federal action related to California, when it comes to sanctuary jurisdictions."
"The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, pursuant to an executive order from the President, are, to the maximum extent possible under Federal law, evaluating and undertaking any lawful actions to ensure that so-called sanctuary jurisdictions which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations do not receive access to Federal funds."
"Further, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, per the terms of the order, are evaluating and undertaking any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction’s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law."
"When it comes to sanctuary policies, California has been the very worst offender in the country."
The State has a sanctuary State policy that was passed in 2017 and is responsible for many tragedies that have been documented throughout our State.
"We even have jurisdictions like Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco that were already sanctuary jurisdictions on top of being within a sanctuary State but are now even going further."
One of them is even passing what they are calling a super sanctuary jurisdiction ordinance.
"Those of us who represent districts in California that are not sanctuary jurisdictions have also asked the administration to be sure to recognize those counties and jurisdictions that are, in good faith, trying to comply with Federal law, very much unlike jurisdictions like Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco."
"These are 10 ways in which we see, finally, something of a check on the runaway lawlessness of the Newsom administration and a number of jurisdictions in California."
"In Congress, we are very much a partner in those efforts."
"Indeed, I am working on a number of measures here in Congress in the House of Representatives that are seeking to push back on the radical, harmful policies of the Newsom administration."
"For example, we recently introduced legislation to overturn Newsom’s ban on gas-powered vehicles."
"I have introduced legislation called the No Medicaid for Illegal Immigrants Act, which will seek to preserve MediCal benefits for American citizens at a time when the policy of expanding those benefits to everyone in the State illegally is literally bankrupting the system."
"In addition to Secretary Duffy’s investigation into high-speed rail’s staggering failures, I have introduced legislation to ensure that the high-speed rail project will be ineligible for any Federal funding going forward."
"California has a long way to go toward restoring sanity, but these actions are very important steps, and I look forward to following these investigations as they protect the civil rights of Californians and protect our citizens against truly radical and failed policies."
TAX CREDITS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, today, I am excited to announce new legislation that I am introducing, along with Representative CLAUDIA TENNEY, called the High-Quality Charter Schools Act, which is going to be among the most significant pieces of legislation for school choice that we have had in this country in a very long time."
What it will do is create a new tax credit for charitable contributions to nonprofit charter school organizations.
"Specifically, it will establish a 75 percent Federal tax credit for qualified charitable contributions made to nonprofit charter school organizations with a proven record of success, incentivizing donations to support the development of more high-quality charter schools."
"This could be truly significant, allowing perhaps millions more kids in this country to gain access to charter schools."
That is because the reality that we see right now is that we have very successful charter schools that get tremendous results for students.
"For example, Success Academy in New York is the number one school system in the entire State, but there are a limited number of seats and it costs a lot of money to start a new school."
"A lot of times, especially in States like California or New York, you are disadvantaged under State law."
We have politicians like Gavin Newsom or the supermajority in California who do everything possible to try to stop us from helping our students succeed.
"There are all of these obstacles that exist, often under State law, as well as the inherent obstacles that exist to starting up an enterprise as complicated and complex as a school, and the Federal charter school grant program has actually been critical to helping a number of charter schools start."
What this legislation seeks to do is to help those that have proven to be successful to expand and replicate their model.
That is because the ones that are really successful often have very long waiting lists.
We can have thousands of kids on a waiting list for a school.
"By the way, charter schools are required to conduct lotteries."
They can’t show any sort of favoritism in their admissions or anything like that.
"They have to be open to all, so they have a lottery."
"If a student doesn’t win the lottery, unfortunately, then he or she can’t go to the school."
"If their local neighborhood school is not a good one, then the child misses out on the opportunity to go to a high-quality school and has to end up going to a low-quality school."
The best and most effective way to expand educational opportunity and excellence in America today is to facilitate the expansion and replication of charter schools that have proven to be successful.
"That is precisely what this legislation does, and I am hopeful we will get it passed into law, perhaps even as part of the reconciliation process as a way to start to turn around this sharp decline in education outcomes that, unfortunately, is posing such a risk to our country’s future."
"I look forward to hopefully getting bipartisan support, seeing it passed into law, and seeing what it will do for so many kids across this country."
RESTORING PUBLIC TRUST IN ELECTIONS Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, this week, I introduced, along with my colleague JAY OBERNOLTE, as well as Representatives CALVERT, FONG, VALADAO, and ISSA, the Election Results Accountability Act, which will restore some measure of public trust in our elections."
"The problem in California, one of many problems with our elections in California, is that they take forever."
"Not only do voters have about a month to cast their votes, but it then takes about a month to actually count the votes, with updates being made periodically throughout what is called a monthlong canvassing period."
"Someone is ahead on election night, but somehow, 3 weeks later, they are behind."
"If you are in a tight race, Mr. Speaker, you are just living and dying with each update: Am I going to be the next city council or school board member?"
"It limits your ability to plan, Mr. Speaker, because you don’t know if you are going to be coming into office or you need to find some other job or if you will be planning to run again, whatever the case may be."
The voters don’t know who is going to be their Representative when they should.
"It also just fosters a sense of distrust in the process, and it is, frankly, embarrassing to our State."
Every other State manages to get its act together.
Most of them can give us the results on election night.
"That is kind of the way it is supposed to work, Mr. Speaker."
"You go to the voting booth, cast your vote, and find out who won that night."
"Mr. Speaker, you don’t find out a month later and have it change several times in the process."
"This is beyond embarrassing for California, and it is time we brought some accountability."

"Additionally, it mandates that States complete the ballot count and certify the final results within 2 weeks of election day."
"Ninety percent of the votes within 3 days need to be counted, and we need to have the results within 2 weeks."
Our State should be more than capable of complying with this.
"By the way, even though we are requiring it in Federal elections, that likely will mean we will get the results up and down the ballot, as well."
"This, along with measures that we passed today, the SAVE Act to require proof of citizenship in order to vote, as well as an initiative that I think is likely to be presented to California voters in the near future to require voter ID, will go a long way toward ensuring election security, election integrity, and the sense of democratic legitimacy on which our State and country’s political identity depends. b 1300 REVERSE CALIFORNIA BAN ON GAS-POWERED VEHICLES Mr. KILEY of California."
"Mr. Speaker, this last week, I introduced legislation in the House to reverse California’s ban on gas-powered vehicles."
This is a special resolution under the Congressional Review Act that provides a fast-track procedure not subject to a Senate filibuster to overturn an agency action.
"In this case, it is the action of the Biden administration that gave Gavin Newsome special permission to ban gas cars in California."
This is a measure that will affect almost everyone in our State.
It is set to go into effect in 2035.
"It is utterly unrealistic, and yet, it has not been subject to a vote of the people, a vote of the State legislature, or a vote of the United States Congress."
"This measure, I believe, will pass hopefully with bipartisan support, and it will restore the ability of Californians to select the vehicle of their choice."
"It will also prevent massive increases in costs for Californians who are already burdened with the highest cost of living, the highest gas prices, the highest energy prices, and much more of any State in the country."
I think this is a pretty commonsense measure.
"Unfortunately, California has dragged a lot of other States along with it with this measure, so it is truly an issue of national concern, as well."
"I look forward to seeing this passed to reverse the Biden administration’s waiver under the Clean Air Act for California, and I think this will go a long way toward restoring some sanity to our State."
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION Mr. KILEY of California.
"Mr. Speaker, this last week as chair of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education that covers K–12 education, I held a very important hearing on the topic of artificial intelligence in education."
"Now, we are in the midst of a truly unprecedented period in which AI is advancing at a mind-boggling rate in terms of its capabilities, and there is truly no end to this progress in sight."
We see all of the leading labs introducing new models it seems like every day that demonstrate increasingly astonishing capabilities.
"There are a lot of risks and concerns that tend to come to mind when people see this progress and a lot of, I think, legitimate fears as it relates to AI and its impact on society."
It is very important that we are attentive to these concerns in taking whatever measures we can to make sure we get these questions right.
"I think that it is equally important that we make sure that the benefits of this technology as it exists now and as it is likely to exist in the future are understood, as well."
"I think that there is, frankly, far less dialogue and conversation on a national level than there should be about the absolutely enormous changes that could well be ahead of us."
I wanted to use this hearing to examine one particular domain where AI holds the potential to dramatically expand opportunity and benefit our country and bring unprecedented opportunities to American kids across the country.
"I am a former high school teacher, and we have in this country truly shameful achievement gaps when it comes to the educational opportunities that are available to kids depending on their ZIP codes."
"In my view, much of that is as a result of failed policies, none more so than in California, which has just about the widest achievement gaps of any State in the country."
"We absolutely need to have policy reforms that bring accountability, that empowers parents, that expands school of choice, and that supports teachers among many other policy reforms."
The correct use of artificial intelligence could go a long way in itself toward bridging these achievement gaps.
"Not only that, I believe that it will very soon be possible for any child in our country to receive a richer educational experience than any child did just a few years ago."
This is because of the absolutely incredible capabilities that are now accessible to anyone for free or at very little cost on a computer or smartphone.
We saw during our hearing examples of how these possibilities are already being realized in many classrooms across America.
"You could have, for example, a personalized tutor who knows just about everything there is to know, who knows everything about your own strengths and weaknesses, your own interests, and who engages with you directly to learn any topic."
"Now, this is no small matter because studies show that having access to a high-quality tutor is one of the most important interventions that improves educational outcomes by a significant degree, potentially moving you a half standard deviation or so or giving you more than a years’ worth of additional learning in any given year if you have access to a high-quality tutor."
"Well, with AI tools, any child will have that access at a level that has never been known before in a more personalized way than has ever been known before."
"What is more, these tools allow for learning across different modalities through text, through images, through voice, and can engage with different students in different ways."
"Just to give you another example, they can take on the form of different characters."
"When you are learning history, you could actually have a conversation with an animated version of a historical figure."
"If you are reading a book, you can actually have a conversation with a character in the book."
"If you are learning physics, maybe you can learn physics from a reanimated version of Einstein himself."
This is just the tip of the iceberg.
"When you look at the technologies that are advancing when it comes to augmented reality, when it comes to VR, we are already seeing ways in which AI is being deployed for sort of career training-type learning, whether it is welding or other types of careers or trades where these environments can be simulated in very realistic ways to help students learn regardless of whether they go to a school or you can get hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of expensive machinery."
I think that we are still just scratching the surface of what is possible here.
"One of the suggestions at our hearing is that we need to continue to facilitate ways of sharing best practices; importantly, as well, when it comes to how these tools can be used by teachers because a teacher’s role is as important as ever, potentially more important, in the sense that having access to AI tools that can assist students in individual ways actually frees teachers in many ways to provide the sort of mentorship and instruction and teaching that only a caring human can."
"We saw examples in our hearing of how AI tools have been used to assist with lesson planning, have been used to help grade papers, or to provide direct immediate feedback to students to help with the assessment process and many other ways, as well."
"For those who think that the AI tool is somehow going to change the role of the teacher, these tools can change the role of the teacher but I think in very positive ways, as well."
"Of course there are risks in this domain, as well, when it comes to academic dishonesty, when it comes to the potential of further absorbing students into digital worlds and thereby exacerbating some of the harms we have seen in excessive use of smart phones."
"All of those things we need to be very mindful of, as well, which is why following VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:04 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.047 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1593 April 10, 2025 our hearing we are exploring ways to establish forums where these sort of best practices can be shared so different teachers, different schools, different States can see what is happening elsewhere, see what the results are, and see the impact it is having on the wellbeing and learning of our students."
"This is one area where I think there truly is unbounded potential, and I am looking forward to working with our subcommittee to try to assist districts across the country and unlocking that potential."
"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f MOURNING THE PASSING OF BOB PHELAN (Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2025, Mr. MCCLINTOCK of California was recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.) Mr. MCCLINTOCK."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of Bob Phelan of Modesto, a valued and beloved member of my congressional staff for these past 3 years."
His was a remarkable life and one that should inspire every American to realize the opportunities that freedom provides.
"When Bob’s father died, he was forced to drop out of high school to work odd jobs to support their family."
"For nearly 10 years, he worked as a crab cracker at Alioto’s restaurant on Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco."
"Searching for a better life, he came to Modesto where his outgoing personality made him an ideal salesman and a manager for such well-known companies as Keebler cookies and Earl Scheib."
"There in Modesto, he met his wife of 31 years, Alta, and raised their family."
"When his son joined the Navy in the Gulf war, Bob’s attention turned to politics."
He became a devotee of Rush Limbaugh and began working for local candidates.
He ended up starting his own political consulting firm.
"Ultimately, he served as a trusted adviser to state assemblymen and then-State senator and also county supervisor Tom Berryhill for nearly 15 years."
"When reapportionment brought my district into Stanislaus County, I was fortunate to bring him into my congressional office where he served ably as my district representative."
"His work ethic, his love for people, his sunny disposition, and his simple decency made him an exemplary figure in our community."
He was always the picture of fitness and health until he was diagnosed last year with cancer.
"He never let that slow him down, and until the very end he continued to attend to his duties."
"He was an exemplary father, husband, grandfather, citizen, and human being, the kind of person who holds a community together even through trying times, and he will be particularly missed."
"Mr. Speaker, it was a great loss for our community, a great loss for our office, but most of all, a great loss for his family."
"Mr. Speaker, on May 17, the College of the Canyons Foundation will honor Marlee Lauffer with the 2025 Silver Spur Community Service Award in recognition of her longtime philanthropic work."
"I first met Marlee as a high school student leader in Tustin, and she was my first and only choice as chief of staff when I was elected to the California State Assembly in 1982."
"Somehow, she was able to clean up every mess I made in those years."
"She continued in that capacity until Newhall Land and Farming Company, the largest land developer in California, recognized her talents and offered her a senior position in their company when she was still in her twenties."
"Well, four decades later, she is still in her twenties, and her energy and devotion to the community has never been stronger."
I am deeply gratified to see her honored by her community and to join in their accolades of her work.
"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f b 1312 TRUMP TARIFFS (Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2025, Ms. KAPTUR of Ohio was recognized for 30 minutes.) Ms. KAPTUR."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of deep concern for the manufacturing workers and families of northern Ohio, from Toledo Jeep to our numerous parts suppliers and union shops across the Great Lakes in both the United States and Canada."
The Trump administration’s reckless and arbitrary tariff policy is putting their jobs and livelihoods at risk.
These billboards just started to go up in our region.
They are a tax on everything.
"While yesterday President Trump claimed to pause all tariffs, he left in place a 10 percent across-the-board tariff on all global trade entering the United States, even in places like our region where we have a very wonderful relationship with companies in Canada."
"We don’t need any tariffs, not at our end of the country."
They are a tax on working Americans and the firms that employ them.
"If not wisely applied, jobs hang in the balance on both sides of our border between the United States and Canada."
"A part in a car or truck, in a steel mill, all of this that happens in our area can cross over the border six times."
Is it going to be a 10 percent tariff put on every time it crosses the border?
They raise prices at the checkout line.
"They disrupt deeply integrated supply chains, like ours, especially with Canada, Ohio’s largest fair trade partner that keeps our auto industry strong and globally competitive."
We don’t need any more problems.
"We have been fighting global competition now for half a century, and it is rough."
"Instead of a blunt Trump instrument, we need a targeted approach that brings real investment to American manufacturing and in the communities hollowed out by decades of bad and broken trade deals and outsourcing."
"We do share in common a deep worry about the trade deficit, but work with us."
"Work with Congress to craft smart, strategic reciprocity agreements with each country."
"Ensure that workers, like United Auto Workers, have a seat at the table, a voice, and real power to negotiate on all sides of all borders."
"For too long, what has been happening is billionaire companies and corporate executives have been taking our production and outsourcing it to penny-wage nations."
"It is slave labor, really, where people make hardly anything, if $1 an hour, maybe $2 an hour, competing against a First World economy like ours."
"As the proud daughter of union workers, I know that the road to rebuilding American manufacturing runs straight through our heartland, through the working class, the people who work hard, the spine of America’s industrial economy in our Great Lakes region and the Midwest."
America’s enemies around the world today are applauding the self-inflicted tariff chaos that has been exacted on our people.
"They are also plotting as they watch the U.S. stock market plummet, and then bounce back a little bit, and then go down again, endangering and impacting markets around the globe."
Reckless and cavalier economic policy could lead us into a Trump recession.
A record of trillions of dollars in U.S. wealth was just lost this past week due to chaotic moves on tariffs arbitrarily imposed by the Trump administration.
"This week, the hole was being dug deeper as markets continued to freefall."
Where will the roller coaster head next week?
None of the tariffs that the President has proposed and implemented have ever had a single vote in this Congress.
"This is unconstitutional, and it has caused a loss in the 401(k) retirement accounts of tens of millions of Americans."
They have been yo-yoing up and down.
We are talking about $10 trillion of market losses these past few days.
Is he asleep at the wheel?
Where is the Republican Committee on Ways and Means?
"The Trump administration’s dangerous overreach is totally damaging to our economy and unnerving to our VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:08 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10AP7.049 H10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1594 April 10, 2025 trade allies around the globe."
Crashing the U.S. and global economy is not in the shortor long-term interests of the American people.
President Trump thought his socalled liberation day was a huge success.
"If the goal was liberating Americans from their hard-earned money and making them pay more for everything, whether it is their car—thousands of dollars more are going to be placed on top of the purchase of a car—the price of energy they pay, the price of gas, and the price of food."
Lumber and housing are outpriced for most people now.
"Meanwhile, when asked about car prices going up, the President gave a rare, troubling response."
He said: ‘‘I couldn’t care less.’’ That is what he said about automotive prices.
"Let us show you what we have done without your help for decades, trying to rebuild the industrial spine of America."
"I will fight for the American auto industry without tanking our economy because, clearly, there are some people in charge who don’t know what they are doing and are raising prices on every single citizen in this country."
What just happened on Wall Street made a whole lot of people nervous.
We got so many phone calls in our office.
Not only are jobs at risk but retirement savings are put at risk.
"I spent too much of my time in this House and in this Chamber trying to repair the economic damage to our economy from trade deals like NAFTA, CAFTA, China PNTR."
They said USMCA was going to fix everything.
The trade deficit is getting worse every year.
"That means our jobs are being hollowed out to someplace else, and they need to be returned to this country."
It won’t just happen because we want it to happen.
"As a private businessman and billionaire, Donald Trump never lifted a finger to help us."
He didn’t stop the outsourcing of jobs during his first term.
We had family farm after family farm collapse across this country through consolidation.
You need a partnership between the legislative branch and the executive branch working with our companies.
"As a result, we have these gigantic trade deficits."
We haven’t had a balanced trade account in this country in over half a century.
There is a cost to that.
"It comes in jobs, wages, and the ability to pay your way forward in your own family."
"It is happening in manufacturing, agriculture, and energy, and there must be reforms in trade policy."
It is not a question of whether but how.
Huge trade deficits translate into growing U.S. debt.
We hear a lot on the other side of the aisle about the debt.
There would be a lot more economic strength if we hadn’t outsourced so many jobs.
"With Canada, our largest fair trade partner, the books look pretty good."
"The Great Lakes folks get along on both sides of the border, so why disrupt something that is working?"
"Tariffs can be a tool to create jobs and wealth, as well as bring back jobs to our country, and we ought to head in that direction."
"Yet, the President’s efforts seem to be adding more trade deficits, not balancing our trade accounts."
America can’t import its way to jobs and wealth.
"We must grow things, make things here, and export them."
"Thus, fair trade with nations that play by the fair trade rules must be our objective."
Let’s work with our friends and then open up other markets and retool other markets where that isn’t working in our interests.
You can’t just do it with a broad brush stroke.
"Working with Canada is very different than working with China, believe me."
"At the same time, we must carefully ensure that we grow jobs here through our trade policies and prevent price gouging by adversaries that benefit from protection in the marketplace."
"Here is what China does: It manufactures four times as much steel as the world consumes, and then it strategically dumps to wipe out production."
"Come with me to Lorain, Ohio."
It is deeply in my heart.
I represented it for 10 years until they gerrymandered our State again and took it away.
"What happened to the workers in Lorain, Ohio, should happen to no worker in this country."
They deserve better for the hard work that they do.
"Mr. Speaker, let’s stop the chaos of trade wars, arbitrary pauses, crazy tariffs, and threats."
The American people sent us here for solutions.
They don’t need more tariffs that are really taxes on their cost of living.
We don’t need to keep hemorrhaging.
That will be the real test.
"The accounts will be the real test at the end of this year, but they are already not looking good."
"Yet, you don’t make it better by killing the patient, the American worker, with higher prices on everything that they buy and by jerking away millions of dollars, the cumulative wealth of their retirement accounts."
"America must achieve free trade among free people, not more tariff chaos."
PASSOVER AND EASTER REFLECTIONS Ms. KAPTUR.
"Mr. Speaker, I wanted to put in a word."
"In our office, as all of this has been going on, I thought a lot about my own faith and how to help the American people who are so worried about what is going on."
I did some reflection on the faith community in which I was baptized and still belong.
"Next Sunday, for us, is the most profound holy day."
"We commemorate Easter, and it holds profound meaning."
"This coming Saturday, in Judaism, Jews around our globe and throughout our Nation will sit down for a Passover Seder."
"For both religions, this weekend is one of the most significant religious holidays in the calendar year, with expression and remembrance on the importance of treasuring our heritage and endowment."
"For 2,000 years or more, these days have expressed faith that can move the human conscience."
Faith motivates people’s behavior to think about the difference between daily life and the divine and what life could be.
"Christians are encouraged to be a sacrificial people and, importantly, a resurrection people."
Jews think of how hard it was for their ancestors escaping Egypt and are thankful for all the joys that they have in modern life.
"With Easter and Passover in mind, I wish to place on the record today reflections as a result of the Trump administration’s recent actions that are causing anxiety among the people who I represent."
"These holy days seem to be a proper time to pray for them, to remember them, and to seriously ask ourselves what we can do together to heal them, our Nation, and our people."
"Days ago, I was approached by a kind nurse who had endured a hard day."
She shared with me that a patient of hers in a local healthcare center had immigrated to our country legally to work as a common laborer.
She had fled a troubled Latin American country where thugs controlled the streets.
"Leaving all behind, the worker had journeyed here from a place where there was no hope for a better future."
"Then, last week here in America, very sadly, she attempted to take her own life with a fentanyl overdose because she feared being arrested by Trump administration immigration officials."
She could not imagine going back to the hell from which she had come.
"Here with no help to understand the law that she came here by, that she could work in America, she was frozen with fear because of what she saw on TV."
I immediately thought of the last words uttered by Jesus as he was put to death by those who could not accept his religious teachings.
"He asked: ‘‘Father, Father, why have You forsaken me?’’ This also parallels the story of Passover with the Jewish people fleeing Egypt in search of a better life, where they could live free from bondage and fear."
"Are we not to care for strangers in a strange land, to treat our neighbors as we would want to be treated?"
Do we leave them to wander the desert or return to horror?
Do we offer a hand out and up to ensure that they can live in safety and security?
I think this is a weekend for examining our own conscience.

Haitians who were here legally and working were scared in Ohio that they would be sent back to the streets of Port-au-Prince that are controlled by warlord gangsters and roving bandits.
Who would want to go back to that?
"These are people who are working, and every company I know is looking for workers right now."
"Local churches, synagogues, and mosques help to resettle Ukrainians here legally who are fleeing war-torn regions in their homeland."
Those Ukrainians all received an erroneous email last week.
"Imagine, when their relatives are fighting and dying in another country, and they are here trying to hold their family together in some minimal way, them receiving a letter saying that they would be able to self-deport before it was claimed to be sent in error."
"In other words, some person in some agency sent out the wrong letter, which causes even more anxiety and fear in families who are already suffering."
What kind of a country are we becoming?
"This week, our district staff took a call from a senior citizen who has ordered her prescription drugs from Canada for many years."
She receives them by mail because she can’t walk.
"She is deeply worried that, with the new 10 percent Trump tariffs across the board, the price of her medicine will go up beyond her ability to afford it."
There are a lot of people in charge of things here in Washington who can’t think in front of their own noses.
They have never faced these situations.
I asked myself: What would Jesus do?
"The Jewish people, who leave the door open and a seat for Elijah, what would they do?"
Our President has even threatened higher tariffs on all imported medicine.
"Boy, that is a hard sock to the gut."
This isn’t something someone who cares about people and their health and well-being would do or should do.
"If I were his mother, I would scold him. b 1330 Our office is receiving numerous inquiries from retirees, working people who worked hard and are deeply concerned about the drop in value of their 401(k) retirement plans that they worked for."
Those just lost enormous value in the financial markets as the Trump tariffs traded away the value of their earnings.
"Meanwhile, the cost of everything keeps rising."
"Where I live, the price of gas rose 75 cents more a gallon than I paid a week before."
I have heard from mothers worried their daughters and granddaughters will lose their Medicaid coverage for mental health care and treatment.
God bless every American family that has a child with mental illness or a relative with mental illness.
You are saints caring for them.
A wife called worried her husband going through chemo for cancer treatment would lose his Medicaid because of the cuts that are being proposed here just 3 years before he becomes Medicare eligible.
"If families are denied access to Medicaid without the finances to cover care, what will happen to them?"
"If your family is lucky and you have never had an ill relative, you are lucky because there are millions of people across this country that are suffering as I deliver these remarks tonight."
People on Medicare are about to lose access to telehealth.
One lady fell out of her bed.
She couldn’t get off the floor.
She had one of those things on her neck that she pushes and then the ambulances came from the local fire department.
There are a lot of people living at the edge.
We have to be concerned about them.
These are just some of the countless stories and fears we hear.
"There are hundreds and thousands more reaching out to Members of Congress in fear for themselves, their families, their loved ones, and treasured members of their community."
America does not live in fear.
That isn’t why our country was founded.
"We have been a refuge for our entire history, and we need to continue to be a refuge for those seeking a better life."
Who will speak up for these people while they are painted as worthless or not worthy of a place in our country by those who just want to slash and burn and tax and deport and destroy?
"Jesus’ last words were uttered in the Aramaic language, and he breathed his last breath asking why he had been forsaken."
We can ask this for people we know and we can do something to help.
"Some of us must ask during Passover and Easter week who is being forsaken in this wild rush to endow the billionaire class with more, more vast infusions of money taken out of the hides and hearts of the American people?"
"Why won’t we as a country and a people ask ourselves the question of how we can help, not hurt?"
How can we help and not hurt?
Let us recommit to that objective in the greatest Nation in the world that needs caring leadership and those that truly are capable of loving one another and other people.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
"Mr. President, Saturday will mark 100 days of the 119th Congress and the Republican majority here in the Senate."
It has been a very productive 100 days.
"We have had 14 weeks of the new Congress, and the Senate has been in session and voting for 13 of those 14 weeks."
"We had the longest continuous in-session work period in 15 years—10 weeks—and yesterday, we took our 200th vote."
That is more votes at this point in a new Congress since at least the Reagan era.
What do we have to show for it?
"Well, Mr. President, we have confirmed the President’s Cabinet at the fastest pace in more than 20 years, and as of this week, we have more than 50 total confirmations."
"Confirming nominees is a big focus of any new Congress with a newly elected President, and we are building out the President’s administration at a brisk pace."
But that is far from the only thing we have done.
We passed Senator BRITT’s Laken Riley Act—the first bipartisan border bill since 2006—which the President signed into law on January 29.
"This legislation, which incorporated amendments by Senators CORNYN, ERNST, and BUDD, ensures that illegal immigrants who steal, assault a law enforcement officer, or kill or seriously injure another person are detained instead of being allowed back on the street."
"We also passed Senator GRASSLEY and Senator CASSIDY’s HALT Fentanyl Act by an even stronger bipartisan margin, to provide law enforcement with critical tools to combat this deadly disease."
"We considered other important bills: Senator TUBERVILLE’s legislation to protect women’s sports, Senator BANKS and Senator LANKFORD’s legislation to protect babies born alive after botched abortions, and Senator COTTON’s ICC sanctions bill."
"All of those were, unfortunately, filibustered by our Democrat colleagues."
"We have also passed six Congressional Review Act resolutions—and plan to pass a seventh today—to repeal burdensome Biden administration regulations, thanks to the effort of, among others, Senators HOEVEN, CRUZ, KENNEDY, RICKETTS, and TIM SCOTT."
"Finally, we considered not one but two budget resolutions to provide the framework for a permanent extension of the 2017 tax relief and a transformational investment in our border, energy, and national security."
I am proud of the role the Senate’s two resolutions have played in advancing negotiations as we head toward a final bill.
"As I have said before, my philosophy of leadership comes from my dad."

"Sports, to him, was not about personal glory; it was about elevating the team."
That is an attitude I have tried to bring to every leadership position I have held.
"When Republican Senators trusted me with the role of majority leader last November, I promised to empower my colleagues and to open up the Senate, and I am proud that we have been making progress toward that goal."
"We have honored the commitment to return to regular order and have brought multiple bills to the floor via the committee process, where Members of both parties have a chance to amend and improve legislation."
We have created additional opportunities for Members to draw attention to their priorities and manage their bills on the floor.
We have done substantial work to cut down vote times to make the process more efficient and free Members up for the other work they have to do.
"I have also been working to ensure that the lines of communication are open at all levels—at the Member level, at the staff level, between the House and the Senate, and between the Senate and the White House."
"I regularly chat with the President and with Speaker JOHNSON so we can ensure that the House, Senate, and White House are all on the same page and doing everything we can to advance our shared goals."
"When we return from Easter, we will continue to have a packed agenda: more nominations to confirm, more burdensome Biden regulations to repeal, a tax bill and border, energy, and national security bill to continue drafting."
Committees are currently working on legislation that will come to the floor in the coming weeks and months.
"Of course, appropriations season is almost upon us, and I remain committed to considering as many appropriations bills as possible under regular order."
"When the Appropriations Committee reports a bill, I intend to bring that bill to the floor for debate."
That will require cooperation from Democrats.
But I hope—I truly hope—that my Democrat colleagues will recognize that the right way to fund the government is to bring individual appropriations bills through the committee process and then consider them on the Senate floor.
"It has been a busy 100 days in the U.S. Senate, and I am looking forward to many more."
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER.
"Mr. President, this morning, I will take a little more than the usual time because I want to review what happened, over the past 8 days, with Trump’s tariff tax so that it can be preserved in the RECORD and so that we as a nation can try to process the reckless, unnecessary damage President Trump has created."
The past 8 days have been an absolute embarrassment for President Trump and for everyone who truly cares about this country.
"During these 8 days, the world saw the President of the United States reveal his total lack of understanding of international trade, macroand microeconomics, and foreign relations."
The world saw the American President issue a tariff ultimatum so ill-conceived and so flawed that it was mocked from here to the Heard and McDonald Islands.
This whole episode is so ridiculous that even the writers of ‘‘Veep’’ and ‘‘House of Cards’’ would have shredded their drafts.
"It had real effects, lasting effects on real people."
Donald Trump’s tariff fiasco caused real damage to the confidence other nations have in America.
It had real effects on the uncertainty we feel every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office.
It had real effects on people’s retirements.
"Let’s start with his announcement on April 2 that that would be ‘‘Liberation Day,’’ a day of massive worldwide tariffs."
"Rather than providing a coherent explanation for such a substantial policy change, the stated justification for this massive tariff application varied, depending on the moment or who the administration spokesperson was."
"Depending on the day, President Trump claimed that tariffs would either balance the budget, enable the elimination of the income tax, or bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States."
"While Peter Navarro gave fullthroated support to all three of those goals, most of the rest of the administration ignored the first two goals and focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States—a worthy goal; one the Democrats, including myself, have been advocating for decades."
"However, even administration officials couldn’t get on the same page."
"While Navarro and Secretary Bessent were talking about the return of jobs, Secretary Lutnick was espousing that manufacturing would be coming back but that it would be automated, he said."
So are we bringing manufacturing jobs back or displacing them with machines?
"It is clear, Mr. President, as April 2 approached, no one—not even the most devoted Trump apologist, except maybe only Ron Vara—believed the President had an actual plan."
"Nevertheless, he persisted, and on April 2, President Trump, against all semblance of common sense, announced tariffs beyond what even the most isolationist Republican could have envisioned."
"The President made some outlandish claims, and he held up a chart with a lot of numbers on it."
"And his claims and those numbers were a surprise to pretty much everyone—everyone—who understands the language, the theory, and the mathematics of trade."
"Putting aside the idiotic tariffs applied to penguins who produce nothing but guano and baby penguins and consume little more than krill and fish and putting aside tariffs on countries that make products Americans crave but lack the purchasing power to buy our products in return, we all quickly realized that the numbers on Donald Trump’s chart were so nonsensical that it took some of the world’s greatest economic minds to reverse engineer it to determine the formula."
"And yet, in perfect Trumpian fashion, his administration released the ‘‘actual’’ formula and the assumptions behind the chart."
"Again, it quickly became clear that he based his entire tariff scheme on a formula so flawed, so economically incoherent that he had to insert some random Greek letters and assign them phony values just to make it look like something out of ‘‘A Beautiful Mind.’’ But instead of a stroke of genius, what we got was gibberish—not genius but gibberish."
"Remember back in 2019, when Hurricane Dorian was approaching Florida and President Trump used a Sharpie to alter a NOAA map to try and cover for his mistake?"
"Well, this phony formula is the 2025 reincarnation of Sharpiegate, except the economic consequences of this fraud will affect millions and millions of Americans."
I won’t stand up here and say I oppose all tariffs.
"I appreciate my supporters on Twitter reminding everyone that I have long championed tough trade policies on China, going back to my early days in the Senate."
"But I and the American people oppose a whimsical, nonsensical approach to international trade, especially one that so clearly will increase costs on American families."
It is one thing to target tariffs on bad actors like China; that makes sense.
But to raise tariffs on allies such as Canada and Israel?
Everyone knows that makes no sense.
"To raise tariffs on random islands as the Falklands, Heard and McDonald, and Svalbard?"
Everyone knows that makes no sense.
To raise tariffs on countries like Madagascar that import little from us but produce products wanted by millions of Americans?
Everyone knows that makes no sense.
"Trump persisted, and the world’s financial markets melted down on Thursday and Friday."

"While the big financial players can hedge against an ignorant, erratic President, everyday Americans who have their hard-earned nest eggs in pension funds, IRAs, and 529 accounts to help pay for their kids’ college tuition don’t have that luxury."
"While the President and his family can create new meme coins and sell cheap made-in-China swag, so that bad actors and sycophants can funnel the money, most Americans don’t have that luxury."
"No, Mr. President, most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck."
"If they are lucky, they put a little away each month for retirement or college savings."
Some of them keep that money in interest-bearing accounts for the stability.
"Their savings are probably doing OK, but costs are going up, so that they may have to dip into those savings."
Some Americans put that money in mutual funds that depend on stability and predictability.
The President let them down as well.
"Of course, some Americans have no exposure to the stock market."
"Their only hope for retirement is Social Security, which congressional Republicans want to gut, and Elon Musk calls a Ponzi scheme."
"But the President also let them down because they may not be exposed, but their employer probably is, as are their neighborhood grocer and hardware store, and they will be affected if any prices rise."
"When the financial markets closed on Friday with one of the biggest drops in history, President Trump was golfing and dining with his Saudi friends."
"On Saturday, while the Nation was stressing over their financial instability, the official White House Press Office gleefully announced that the President would, on Sunday, compete in his club’s golf championship."
"This was the Trump version of ‘‘Let them eat cake’’—‘‘Let them eat cake.’’ Then on Sunday, after a week of uncertainty, a weekend of stress, while small business owners, retirees, and young families across the country were sitting at their kitchen tables trying to figure out how they were going to handle this dramatic increase in costs, what was the President doing?"
"He was, of course, still golfing."
"And to the surprise of no one, except for maybe the actual tournament winner, President Trump tied for his own club championship, a remarkable achievement, to be sure."
"In fact, so great is that achievement that, if the President would make public his scorecard, I would gladly enter it into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and ask for its preservation at the National Archives, though I am sure his caddy would be reluctant to testify under oath."
I know the President likes to talk about his handicap.
"Over the weekend, his administration tried to cover up for his indifference by claiming that ‘‘more than 50 countries’’ had reached out to start negotiations."
"That claim may have temporarily calmed the futures market, but its unbelievability certainly harmed the White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett’s credibility."
Adding to the uncertainty and lack of faith was the incoherence within the administration that was in full public effect over the weekend.
"In between golf swings, the President found time to post: WE WILL WIN."
"HANG TOUGH, it won’t be easy."
"Meanwhile, America’s de facto President, Elon Musk, told a globalist conference in Italy he wanted a ‘‘zero-tariff situation’’ between the United States and Europe."
"That aspiration was quickly and directly rebutted by the tariff architect, Peter Navarro, which led to a public spat the likes of which the Presidency has rarely seen."
"On Monday, the markets started low but quickly skyrocketed because some ‘‘verified’’ Trump Twitter account announced that an administration official said Trump would pause tariffs for 90 days."
"The world and the markets rejoiced, but the administration quickly refuted that assertion, and the markets fluctuated downward."
"Tuesday started with great optimism and a quick market rise, but China’s retaliation and the rumors of a European equivalent turned the rally bearish, which brings us to yesterday, Wednesday, April 9."
"Mr. President, history will likely record this day as America’s actual ‘‘Liberation Day’’ because it is the day that President Trump backed down— backed down."
"Of course, as with anything Trump does, his backing down created a few private winners and several public losers."
"We may never discern who the private winners are, but we do know that, at 9:37 a.m., President Trump posted, in all capital letters: THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!"
What exactly was the purpose of this post?
Why did he feel the need to add his initials to this particular post?
Was it a signal to his friends and family that he was going to pause the tariffs so they should buy low knowing the market would boom?
Was this another ‘‘stand back and stand by?’’ We may never know.
"But we need to find out, and it must be investigated."
"Now, we certainly know who the losers are."
The losers are the millions of Americans who tried to protect their positions and sold assets during the downturn.
They were let down by President Trump.
The losers are the administration officials who tried their level best to cover for President Trump’s instability by spinning to the media only to have the President undercut their credibility.
We shouldn’t be surprised by this.
"We all lived through the first Trump Presidency, after which he even admitted he hired bad people; but here, in his second term, the effort that President Trump puts into destroying the credibility of his staff is utterly incomprehensible."
"To paraphrase a former Trump official: People think Trump is playing 3D chess, but most of the time, the staff is just trying to keep him from eating the pieces."
That is what happened this week.
Trump’s sycophants—FOX News and Republican Senators—are all used to this game.
They know the President is dead wrong; that he is not remotely a very stable genius.
Yet none of them want to tell the emperor that he has no clothes.
"Secretary Lutnick’s credibility is shot because of his full-on defense of this tariff scheme, followed by his admission that it wouldn’t result in American jobs because automation would take over."
Secretary Bessent’s credibility is shot because of his public attempts to defend the President’s ever-changing whims.
He spent the weekend and the week saying the administration doesn’t want deals; that we are bringing manufacturing back; that we aren’t pausing.
"As recently as yesterday, he made the Orwellian claim that Main Street would benefit from this tariff scheme."
"But then, today, his full humiliation was complete as he tweeted after the President backed down: No one creates leverage for himself like @POTUS."
The President even undercut his Trade Representative during a congressional hearing.
Jamieson Greer spent hours defending the President’s tariff policy only to learn of the President’s backtracking while he was sitting at the witness stand.
"Then, after hours of administration officials claiming that this wasn’t a backtrack and that it was the plan all along, President Trump goes to the mics and undercuts his team by saying he caved because he was watching the bond markets, and people were getting nervous."
"So now, Mr. President, you and 330 million of your fellow Americans and countries across the planet are asking: Where are we?"
"Sadly, no one knows, not even President Trump."
Some proposed tariffs have been reduced.
"Our neighbors in Canada and Mexico are asking how this applies to them, and they can’t get straight answers."
"The President himself has leaned into the uncertainty, offering that he may give breaks to certain companies—we should assume those that are owned by his family and his friends."
That is how this administration rolls.
"Asked yesterday about potential tariff reprieves for companies, he replied— this is President Trump: There have been some that have been hit hard . . ."
There are some that by the nature of the company get hit a little bit harder and we’ll take a look at that.
"So, as we look back on this week of self-made chaos and even destruction, VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:30 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.003 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2536 April 10, 2025 we have to ask: What was the purpose of this exercise?"
What was the purpose of this exercise?
"Was it, as President Trump originally said, to force other countries to pay enough tariffs so the United States could eliminate the income tax?"
"Was it, as President Trump said later, to retaliate against countries that were unfair to us?"
"No. That was never true, but even if it were, Trump backed off that."
"Was it, as some sycophants and Cabinet Secretaries have claimed, some 4D chess move to call China’s bluff?"
No. Everyone knows that isn’t true.
"This was not a week of 3D chess, 4D chess, or even checkers."
"Again, to paraphrase a former Trump official: People think Trump is playing 3D chess, but most of the time, the staff is just trying to keep him from eating the pieces."
"President Trump is a guy who lights the house on fire, calls 9–1-1, and then his MAGA sycophants and Republican Senators hit the airwaves and take to social media to laud him for putting out the fire."
"The President did real harm—real harm—to America and Americans over the last week, and Senate Republicans stood by and cheered."
Senate Democrats will do everything we can to help minimize the damage.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, I just heard my colleague—the previous majority and now minority leader, the senior Senator from New York—talk about a number of things that just reflect on the fact of why he is now the minority leader instead of the majority leader."
"It is because of the elections in November, and it was an election that was won by Republicans because the previous administration had been the administration of high prices and open borders."
So I would like to address those two things today and show why the American people made the right decision in November when they were focused on high prices and an open border.
"All I need to do is to turn to a headline this morning that talks about how ‘‘inflation cooled,’’ how inflation is lower than expected for this past month."
"The Washington Post headline, ‘‘Inflation cooled significantly in March.’’ The Axios headlines, ‘‘Consumer prices fall in March.’’ Then CNN, this morning, noted that consumer prices, month over month, dropped for the first time since COVID."
Republicans promised to get America back on track.
"Then, when it comes to the border, remember the headline from the past, ‘‘Migrant crossings soar to near-record [high] levels’’?"
"That was by CBS News, on September 21, 2024, about 6 weeks prior to the election."
Record-high border crossings were a reality in Joe Biden’s final months in the White House.
"Biden then had about 7,000 illegal immigrants flooding across the southern border each and every day—7,000 a day from San Diego, CA, all the way to my home State, to Sheridan, WY."
Every city in America was a border State.
"Let’s fast-forward to today where we see the inflation numbers looking good—down, improved—since the first time since COVID."
Let’s take a look at the border today.
"With President Trump in charge, things have changed dramatically."
"Last month—the entire month—illegal border crossings dropped to 7,000—7,000 for the month."
That is the lowest monthly total in decades.
"So we went from 7,000 illegal immigrants a day under Joe Biden to 7,000 illegal immigrants for the entire month of March."
This turnaround isn’t luck; it is leadership—and there is a big difference.
Joe Biden recklessly dismantled our border security.
"In his first 100 days in office, he signed 94 Executive actions."
President Trump has restored decisive enforcement in his first 100 days.
Illegal border crossings have dropped by 94 percent.
The New York Post hailed this as a ‘‘stunning new low’’ in border crossings.
ABC News said: Southwest border crossings for March [were the] lowest in history.
The Washington Post wondered: [Whatever] happened to the border crisis?
"Well, let me tell you what happened."
This is what happens when a President stops coddling the criminals.
This is what happens when a President starts enforcing the law.
The current administration delivered what the American people wanted.
"Cartel killers, drug dealers, murderers, and rapists are getting hauled in and thrown out by the thousands."
"Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports that there have been over 100,000 deportations in 80 days."
Yet the fight is just beginning.
"Last week, a college student was killed by an illegal immigrant in a hit-and-run."
The student’s name was Nate Baker.
Nate attended the University of South Carolina.
He had just turned 21 years old 2 weeks before.
This is a death that was preventable.
His killer has been identified and was identified by Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the last 5 years.
"His killer is one of more than 600,000 illegal immigrant criminals still in our country."
These are the very illegal immigrants who President Trump and his team are deporting.
"Deaths like Nate’s, the drug overdoses, the families who have lost loved ones—those are real human costs to American citizens as a result of open borders."
Open borders aren’t compassionate as Democrat after Democrat continues to claim and as NANCY PELOSI talks about.
"Grieving families like Nate’s deserve justice, not half measures."
"Public safety demands we deport illegal criminals, not coddle them."
This is why Senate Republicans have taken action.
"On Saturday, we passed a budget roadmap for a safer, more prosperous nation."
It includes $175 billion in border funding.
It puts us on a path to finish the wall.
It boosts Immigration and Customs Enforcement staffing.
It provides for much greater detention capacity for the lawbreakers.
"Remember, those are the lawbreakers Joe Biden openly invited into our country."
"President Trump, Secretary Kristi Noem, and Border Czar Tom Homan say this budget is the muscle that they need to be able to complete the job."
I agree with them—they are right—and that is what we are ready to deliver.
When it came to the vote on the Senate floor—on this very floor—Senate Democrats voted unanimously against border security.
"One after another after another, as their names were called, voted no."
They weren’t going to secure the border.
Continue to invite in the criminal cartels and the drug dealers.
"For 4 years, Senate Democrats welcomed open border policies that left our communities vulnerable, and Democrats in this body, last week, still supported those reckless, irresponsible policies of open borders."
"Republicans offered solutions, not the Democrats, who offered resistance to what we were doing to secure the border."
"Americans saw the difference last November, and they voted that way."
They chose strength and security over crime and chaos.
That is what the American people want—strength and security.
"The numbers speak for themselves— 7,000 illegal immigrants per day under Joe Biden last year to 7,000 a month now."
It is a difference that will save American lives.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
TRIBUTE TO MEGHAN TAIRA Mr. SCHUMER.
"Mr. President, on July 16, 2007—a while back—I hired a legislative assistant to handle our healthcare and education policy."
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:30 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.004 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2537 April 10, 2025 I didn’t know it then, but this new member of my team, this native of Hawaii who came to work for a Senator from New York—she did live in New York for a while and went to high school there."
"I always tease her about the high school she went to, Brearley— would, in time, become my legislative director."
She would stay with my team not just for years but for almost two decades—two decades.
"She would become one of the most talented, most effective, and most trusted advisers I ever, ever had—and I have had a lot of good ones—this person, of course, who is sitting next to me right here, Meghan Taira, the best legislative guru I could have ever asked for, the best legislative director in the business."
That says a lot because there have been a lot of good ones there too.
"Tomorrow, after 18 wonderful years, Meghan will move on from her time in the Senate."
"She sat in this chair many times directing me, helping the Senate move forward."
"This will be her last time sitting in that chair, and we are the lesser for it because she is so great."
We won’t dwell on the goodbyes— that is too bittersweet—and instead we will all say thank you to Meghan Taira.
"Thank you for 18 wonderful years—18, wow, amazing."
"Now, Meghan, one thing I will say, and you will shake your head in agreement, thank you for putting up with me—not so easy—every day, all day, on the phone."
I will call Meghan at 6 in the morning.
"I will call her at 11 at night, after she had put her beautiful boy to bed, again and again and again."
"Thank you, Meghan, for being the field general of our team, the field general we needed all those years."
"Like all great Leos, she is a natural leader, fiercely loyal, not just to me but to everyone in her office."
"She exuded confidence every single day, no matter what problem lay before us."
"I would see these problems, and I would say: Oh, my God, how are we ever going to solve that?"
"She would walk in, have her solution, and poof, it was solved."
She was by my side in some of the most pivotal moments of my time in this Chamber.
Meghan counseled me and my whole team as we worked to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009.
It wouldn’t have been as good of a law as it was without Meghan Taira.
"Seven years later, she was at my side again defending the ACA from repeal, leading our caucus to hold the line."
"No one thought we would, but we did."
It wouldn’t have happened without Meghan Taira.
"Meghan, if the rest of the world could see you in action like I have, from the way you set the tone each morning to the way you walked all of us through the bills, taking this complicated legislative language and putting it into normal language that we can understand, the way you talk about each vote, each floor fight, the way you are able to predict—how do I shut this off?"
"This is something Meghan is used to, being interrupted by my cell phone at every moment."
Somehow I can’t shut the thing off.
"Anyway, everyone would think what I think if they could watch you, and that is, thank God there is a Meghan Taira around."
"I know there are lots of ‘‘Schumerland’’ alumni watching right now, our great staff team, running along the whole top place there, many more are watching on TV—hello, Schumerland."
"You are a big, wide group, but almost every one of you have been trained and been made a better staffer by Meghan Taira, and all of Schumerland thinks the same."
"Maybe they think I am not being superlative enough because on a good day, getting things done in the Senate, they know— our staff knows—it is hard."
"On hard days, getting things done seems nearly impossible."
"And then you have the strange days, like we just went through with vote-aramas."
"How many vote-aramas have you been through, Meghan?"
"Thirteen, a lucky number, in this case, for us."
"It takes a special talent, a bit of a mad genius to keep nearly 50 U.S. Senators facing in the right direction at 3 a.m. during an amendment vote."
"We had every Democrat unified on all—what was it, 27 amendments?"
"Maybe more, but at least 27 amendments."
"But that is what Meghan has been doing all these years, a compass pointing us in the right direction, the animating spirit of my leadership and legislative team."
"Most importantly, it takes a really special person to dedicate so many years of their life—nights, weekends, holidays, life events—to work in the Senate."
She and her husband Gerry— they met on my staff; they were a Schumer marriage—are so dedicated to their boy George.
It is such a beautiful thing watching him grow up.
She was always both busy with George and paying attention to legislation at the same time.
I would hear George in the background on many of our calls.
"One day, maybe he will be a great legislative leader as well."
"But it takes a special person to dedicate so many nights, so many weekends, so many holidays, and so many life events to work in the Senate."
"So, Meghan, you have made your mark on the Senate, on the State of New York, on the United States of America, and even the world."
"There are, undoubtedly, people living happier and healthier lives on all the continents because Meghan Taira sat in this chair and the chair at her desk in her office for so many years."
"Without Meghan, none of our greatest accomplishments of the last 18 years would have been possible: no infrastructure bill, no Chips and Science, no IRA, no gun safety, no marriage equality, and so much more."
"Without her, pandemic relief would have been half as strong, half as generous, half as sweeping as it was when America needed the whole thing; it needed boldness."
There would be no paid family leave for Federal workers.
New York hospitals wouldn’t have gotten their lifeline to stay afloat during COVID.
Hundreds of thousands of people owe their jobs to Meghan because they would have closed down if we hadn’t done that during COVID.
"Under Meghan’s tenure, we negotiated the first bipartisan budget deal, in 2017, where we finally raised domestic spending to parity with defense."
"She was 8 months pregnant when she negotiated that bill—superlady, superwoman, superperson, super everything."
I had asked her that before.
"She saw 2,000 bills—2,000 bills—become law and helped me write and introduce no less than 260 pieces of legislation."
And I am just so lucky that she did it all as a member of my team.
"So, Meghan, you have checked out perhaps more books than anybody from the Library of Congress or more than any staffer I know, but now you will get to check out books that you want to read, not that your job requires you to read, because I know you love to read."
And I am happy that George and Gerry will get to see mom around the house more.
"Though you are going to move on to greener pastures, Meghan, a piece of you will always dwell in these Chambers, in these halls, in this great institution, and in my heart."
Am I allowed to stand up and hug you on the floor of the Senate?
I yield the floor. (Applause.) The PRESIDING OFFICER.

"Mr. President, there has been a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth in the mainstream media about President Trump’s commonsense immigration enforcement agenda."
That is one of the reasons he got elected on November 5.
"It is because the American people were fed up with open borders and with the 70,000 Americans who died of fentanyl poisoning, not to mention all of the criminals who came across the border along with everybody else."
"But to listen to some of my Democratic colleagues talk, one would think that Kristi Noem is deporting grandmothers."
"Well, this couldn’t be further from the truth."
So I want to take just a minute to correct the record to talk about exactly what is happening.
"The Trump administration is rightly carrying on one of the most basic functions of the government, and that is to keep our people safe."
"In order to keep the American people safe, we need to keep criminals and gangs off our streets, and that is exactly what the Trump administration is doing."
"The Department of Homeland Security recently announced they made more than 32,000 enforcement arrests in just 50 days—32,000."
"This is nearly as many arrests as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, made in the entirety of fiscal year 2024 when border crossings and ‘‘gotaways’’ were at an alltime high."
"Obviously, this was not a priority for the Biden administration, and we are all living with the consequences."
"Of these arrests that have been made under Secretary Noem, nearly half of them have been convicted criminals and others with final orders of deportation."
"These are people who were either criminals and did not want to appear in front of law enforcement, who were apprehended, or people who claimed asylum or some other legal benefit and lost their cases and are under final orders of deportation but were allowed to remain in the country under the Biden administration."
"Of these arrests that have been made under Secretary Noem, as I said, nearly half are convicted criminals."
One-third of them have pending criminal charges.
"Nearly 1,200 of them are criminal gang members, and 39 are known as suspected terrorists."
The Department of Homeland Security isn’t carrying out this critical mission alone.
"This is a whole-of-government approach, as it should be."
"The Department of Justice is partnering with the Department of Homeland Security on a new interagency initiative to crack down on international organized crime, known as Operation Take Back America."
"International gangs, like MS–13 and Tren de Aragua, have been wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in communities across America."
"MS–13, for those who are not familiar with that particular gang, is reputed to be the most dangerous gang on the planet."
"It is composed primarily of Salvadoran criminal aliens and has 30,000 members around the world, including 10,000 here in the United States."
"Their VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:30 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.007 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2539 April 10, 2025 motto is ‘‘kill, rape, control.’’ As I said, they are one of the largest and most dangerous street gangs in the United States."
"Many of their leaders are currently in prison in El Salvador for crimes like murder, kidnapping, and extortion."
"However, some on that side of the aisle or in the mainstream media have actually gone so far as to describe MS– 13 as Boy Scouts in comparison with the destruction and devastation that has happened at the hands of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang known for human trafficking, kidnapping, and drug trafficking."
"This particular Venezuelan gang has been particularly aggressive in my home State of Texas, where the Department of Public Safety arrested more than 40 of the gang’s suspected members just last week."
"In New York, Tren de Aragua has been recruiting gang members from New York migrant shelters, increasing cell phone robbery activities, and trafficking stolen phones back to their headquarters in South America."
"But the reason this gang became the topic at dinner tables across America was that they were responsible for the murders of both Laken Riley and a fellow Texan, Jocelyn Nungaray."
I can’t imagine anyone would be anything except relieved that the Trump administration has prioritized the removal of these gang members from our country.
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice have shown an ability and a commitment to lock up these dangerous international terrorists at breakneck speed.
"As part of this initiative, a recently created task force in Virginia—just across the river—arrested 247 individuals in 2 weeks."
So this is not just a phenomenon in border States like mine.
"These people are embedded around the country—literally, in every State."
"Among these arrests in Virginia was Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, one of MS–13’s top gang leaders, who was charged, in this instance, with illegal gun possession."
"Another MS–13 leader, Joel VargasEscobar, was arrested in New York just last week."
"This particularly dangerous criminal was most recently arrested for his alleged involvement with 11— 11—murders, but this was not his first run-in with the law."
"He was previously arrested and deported back in 2018, but due to the Biden administration’s open border policies, he was able to illegally enter the country again."
"The Department of Homeland Security recently announced that, in less than a week, ICE has arrested 68 gang members of the Venezuelan gang that I mentioned a moment ago."
"With Secretary Noem and Attorney General Bondi at the helm, I think we can all sleep more easily knowing that law enforcement is finally able to do their job, which is to enforce the law— something the Biden administration seemed positively allergic to."
"As a result, our homeland will be safer and more secure."
The Trump administration is committed to dismantling these international criminal organizations that have created so much havoc and heartache throughout our country.
It should be obvious and universal that keeping our citizens safe is not a partisan exercise.
"It is nothing more than common sense, and it is actually the responsibility of government to enforce the laws that Congress passes."
Refusing to arrest and lock up criminals who never should have been in the country in the first place will go down in history as one of the biggest mistakes the Biden administration and Democrats have ever made.
The Trump administration is rightly correcting the terrible mistakes of the Biden administration.
"The American people deserve to live in a country where they don’t have to be fearful for their safety, and that is what they voted for last November 5."
Parents should not have to worry about their children never being seen or heard from again simply because they go for a jog like Laken Riley did.
Far too many innocent people have lost their lives because of the Biden administration’s open border policies and failure to keep criminals and gangs out.
"It is incomprehensible to me that the President of the United States refused to enforce the laws, and it has resulted in so much pain and misery and heartache among so many people in this country."
"The Trump administration’s, by contrast, arrests and deportations of criminal migrants here is part of the solution, not part of the problem."
"I am confident the American people know nonsense when they hear it, even when it is broadcast over mainstream media, and the fearmongering that we hear on the left about the Trump administration’s efforts to keep all Americans safe are nothing more than that."
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, when it comes to new tax breaks for billionaires, Republicans are going to work around the clock and stay through the night."
"But when it comes to stopping Trump’s trade war for good, when it comes to stopping a tax increase aimed squarely at working families, when it comes to stopping the complete uncertainty that is chipping away at confidence in our economy, most Republicans can’t be bothered, never mind that Trump is now pushing us into a recession and sending the markets whipsawing back and forth every time he tweets."
"Trump may be retreating now from some of his most outlandish tariffs, but make no mistake, his trade war is far from over."
"First of all, he is still taxing goods from every country, across the board, at 10 percent, at least."
"That means higher prices and serious pain for families and small businesses across our country; not to mention, he is only escalating his boneheaded trade war with China with 145 percent tariffs."
There is no question we are in fierce competition with China.
I chaired a committee hearing focused on this.
We need to be competing to win.
But that is not what Trump is doing.
Do my Republican colleagues understand it is not setting America up for success to launch an all-out trade war with the second largest economy in the world on a whim?
"While people might be temporarily relieved by this so-called pause on the even higher tariffs, the fact of the matter is that Trump is only delaying them."
"The threat of even larger taxes, which American families simply cannot afford, is still like a timebomb, set to blow up our economy in 90 days."
"If Congress does not defuse that economic bomb, there is a real threat that it will blow up balance sheets for small businesses and farms, college savings accounts for our students, and your retirement savings, along with a lot more."
"I have to emphasize the uncertainty and the constant, by-the-hour reversal of Federal policy."
That alone is already causing massive harm.
How on Earth are you supposed to build your business if your costs skyrocket on a tweet?
How are you supposed to plan for retirement when the President is sending your 401(k) on a roller-coaster ride every time he is in a bad mood?
"How are we ever going to rebuild trust—trust—with our trading partners across the world when the message the United States is sending right now is that our trade relationships are built on sand, and there is no logic to the tariffs the United States will impose?"
How are they supposed to feel good about negotiating with a country where one man can totally burn down the economy and Congress will not lift a finger to stop him?
"Instead of building stronger trade agreements, Trump is pushing our partners away and pushing them toward striking deals with China and our other adversaries."
"Mark my words, this chaotic chapter is not over, as much as Republicans want to pretend otherwise."
I have been hearing from small businesses that are in an absolute panic because of Trump’s tariff threats.
Car dealerships are seeing sales plummet because Trump is sending prices higher.
Restaurants are trying to stock up on any goods they can because their ingredients are about to get more expensive.
"Our growers are bracing for rising operating costs and retaliatory tariffs, and that will drive up prices at our grocery stores."
"Ten percent, across-the-board tariffs are still bad enough to ruin families’ finances."
"While Republicans are showing with their own actions that they couldn’t VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.011 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2540 April 10, 2025 care more about shuffling trillions— and, yes, that is ‘‘t,’’ trillions—at billionaires, Trump has said, in his own words—in his words—that he ‘‘couldn’t care less’’ about the pain his tariffs are already causing for Americans."
He actually said that about automobile tariffs.
"This is what happens when you only have billionaires in charge because, of course, Trump doesn’t care if the car prices go up by a couple thousand dollars."
"Of course, Elon Musk doesn’t care if your groceries are getting more expensive—at the same time Republicans are cutting nutrition programs, by the way."
"Of course, the richest people in the world don’t care if your nest egg is crushed or your small business shutters or your house gets foreclosed on or your kid can’t go to college."
Billionaires are going to be fine.
"After all, they are still getting a tax cut."
But I wasn’t sent here to fight for billionaires.
"We are here to fight for families back home, and they are already starting to get crushed by Trump’s tariffs."
And they are bracing for impact if Trump doubles down in 90 days.
"Or who knows, maybe Trump changes his mind again tomorrow."
"It is anyone’s guess at this point, which is, by the way, the problem here."
"Another thing, if this is about American manufacturing, tell us: Why are plants and new investments being canceled?"
"Why has Trump been freezing and outright canceling grants that we passed to support chips manufacturing or clean energy, and more, killing American jobs?"
"Let’s keep in mind, these tariffs affect building and construction too."
Trump is actually making it more expensive to build those factories in America.
"And don’t forget, President Trump is still promising more tariffs."
He said this week—this week—he wants to put tariffs on medicine.
"I have got to tell you, one thing I have never heard—not in a single meeting, not once in my entire career as a Senator—is someone saying: Gee, I really wish my prescriptions were more expensive."
Drug costs are out of control.
Families are already skipping meals or rationing doses.
"There are real stakes here, there is real damage already happening in this country because of Trump’s new taxes and this ongoing chaos."
"We here cannot ignore this harm, especially when the threat is still there."
"When you are putting out a fire, you don’t say: Oh, great, it is smaller; I am done."
You keep going until the fire is put out.
"This fire—this fire—is still raging, and if we don’t act here, folks back home are the ones who are going to get burned."
"And before too long, in 90 days, we could see even more price increases come roaring back, because, let’s be real, Trump has no exit strategy."
That much is already painfully clear.
It was clear when he announced tariffs that were calculated using ridiculous math.
It was clear when he repeatedly doubled down on these threats against our allies.
And it was clearer than ever when he backtracked on the most absurd tax hikes.
"This does not have the hallmarks of a grand strategy, and it is all the more reason why Congress—us—needs to step in and put this mess to an end."
Trump’s trade war is all pain and no plan.
We could be passing legislation right here to reject this chaos.
"Here is what everyone—my colleagues, my constituents, the markets around the world—all need to understand: This chaos will not be over for good unless we here in Congress vote to end it, because whatever Trump tweets today, he can reverse tomorrow."
"Whatever deal he may strike one minute, he may rip up the next."
He proves it at every opportunity.
"We here in Congress, we are the offramp if Republicans decide to be."
We are the check on Presidential power.
We are the kill switch for Trump’s trade war.
"And, by the way, we are about to be out of town for 2 weeks."
"I cannot understand why any Republican would want to leave this business unfinished, want to leave this economic timebomb ticking, want to hand over our constitutionally granted power to impose tariffs."
"But I can tell you, for the next 2 weeks, I am going to be going across my home State of Washington raising this alarm."
"I am going to be meeting with families, small businesses—people who are paying the cost of Trump’s new tax increase and who are going to see their world turned upside down if we do not take action to stop this from getting worse."
"And when we get back here in 2 weeks, you can bet your bottom dollar, I will lift those stories up as high as I can."
I will call for action as loud as I can.
"I am going to keep a bright and burning spotlight on all of the chaos Trump has caused, and I will keep the pressure on all of our colleagues."
I will not let Republicans off the hook on this.
We can put an end to this.
The costs are just going to be adding up.
The carnage is going to continue to pile higher.
How long do you want to wait?
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, yesterday was a day that really captured the attention of the world."
"We have all been talking about tariffs for a little bit, but yesterday was the day that really brought the focus to what was going on here in the United States."
"At 12:01 in the morning on Wednesday, President Trump’s tariffs on the countries with which the United States has had the largest trade deficits went into effect, on top of the 10-percent tariff rates that had previously applied to all countries, which had been initiated on Saturday, April 5."
"And then just hours later yesterday afternoon, the President announced a 90-day pause on lowering reciprocal tariffs to then 10 percent—at the same time announced that he was raising tariffs on China to 125 percent."
"Now today, it looks like that number is closer to 145 percent."
"To say this has been a dizzying week in Washington, DC, is probably an understatement."
"Those of us who are following the markets, it has been somewhat headspinning."
I am not going to comment here on the floor today about the negotiating tactics of President Trump.
I think he is legendary and really world-renowned for his skills at that—his skills in bringing nations to the table.
We are seeing some of this play out literally as we speak; other countries that have approached the administration to have discussions about tariffs.
"This is a unique kind of leverage, most certainly keeping those across the table off-balance."
"But bringing the world, potentially, to a—to the brink of a ruinous trade war certainly qualifies as a very unique point of leverage."
"The effort to try to reshore manufacturing here in this country is important, it is admirable, and it is something that we all should be working toward."
"But I think there has been general agreement that the message from the administration has been decidedly mixed, which leads to further confusion among our trading partners and our allies."
"If nobody understands where the finish line is, it is hard to reach it."
I don’t want to focus my comments here this afternoon about these possible strategies and end results of these policies so much.
But I want to focus more on the process of how these tariffs were imposed because I believe—I believe—it is yet another example of Congress is choosing to cede its powers to the executive branch.
"If the global implications of these tariffs have shown us nothing else, it is that measures that are as important as the issue be considered by the 535 elected individuals that are in tune with the American people rather than vesting that with just one individual acting unilaterally."
"It is under article I section 8 of our U.S. States Constitution that clearly enumerates that Congress ‘‘shall have Power To Lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.’’ In other words, the power to levy tariffs rests with us here in Congress."
So why—why—have we seen the Executive take control over tariff rates?
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.013 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2541 April 10, 2025 And the answer lies in almost a century-long series of bills that we have seen here that Congress has voluntarily—voluntarily—enacted and laid down its authority for the Executive to pick up."
"Following the disastrous SmootHawley Act of 1930, which plunged our Nation deeper into the Great Depression, Congress passed the following legislation: First, it was the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which authorized the President to make limited tariff rates without congressional review on top of negotiating bilateral reciprocal trade agreements."
"Then it was the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which broadened the President’s trade powers to include multilateral trade agreements while also allowing the President to unilaterally impose tariffs if imports could threaten national security."
"Then the Trade Act of 1974, which allowed the President to protect U.S. workers by adjusting tariffs if foreign countries engaged in unfair trade practices."
"And then just a few years later, it was the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which gives the President authorities to address declared emergencies if ‘‘unusual and extraordinary’’ threats exist to national security, foreign policy, or to the economy."
So powers include—you probably guessed it—the authority to ‘‘regulate’’ or ‘‘prohibit’’ imports.
"So in his April 2 Executive order, President Trump declared a national emergency because of ‘‘a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships’’ and our ‘‘trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages.’’ He is authorized—he is authorized to do so under the National Emergencies Act of 1976."
So I want to be clear about all of this.
"I know some people might not like it, but all of what he has done is clearly above board."
"The President is clearly within his powers to impose tariffs on our allies like Mexico and Canada and the EU just as much as he is with our adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran."
"President Trump, and President Biden before him, took this route because Congress has largely relegated tariff authority to the President through the laws that effectively cede to the Executive."
"And, my friends, it is just one more example—just one more example—of Congress abdicating instead of legislating."
"In my time here, I have seen a troubling pattern in both bodies where the party that controls the White House seems all too comfortable relinquishing authority to the President and then rubberstamping whatever policies the Executive wants enshrined into law."
"Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have deferred to the Executive to call the shots, in my view, for far too long."
"Now, we use the phrase around here a lot, ‘‘coequal branches of government.’’ I use it all the time."
"But the reality is, Congress was created in article I—article I of the Constitution."
We are given far more authority than the Executive.
All you need to do is look in your handy-dandy pocket Constitution.
"Ours is a lot longer, but look at the authorities that we have: Congress may impeach and remove a President and members of the judiciary; Congress can override a Presidential veto of legislation; Congress appropriates the money that funds the operation of all branches of government; and it is Congress that, again, needs to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises."
"We also say a lot around here that ‘‘business loves certainty.’’ I would suggest the country’s entire tariff regime being subject to the whims of one individual lends anything but certainty, and that is why—that is why— I have signed onto Senator GRASSLEY and Senator CANTWELL’s legislation."
"They call it the Trade Review Act of 2025, and it would reclaim this branch’s authority and duty to help manage tariffs as outlined in the U.S. Constitution."
"The bill requires notice to the Congress of the imposition of—or increase in—any tariffs, requires notice to the Congress in 48 hours; and with that congressional notification, it has to include an explanation of the President’s reasoning for imposing or raising the tariffs as well as providing an analysis of potential impact on American businesses and consumers."
"I can tell you, the Alaskans that I am talking to back home would really like the last part of this, an analysis of: How is this going to impact us?"
"Another provision within the Grassley-Cantwell act is, within 60 days, Congress would pass a joint resolution for approval on the new tariff."
"Otherwise, all new tariffs on imports could expire on that deadline."
So what this act effectively would do would be to reaffirm Congress’s role with regards to tariffs.
"It allows for a greater engagement, if you will, between the executive and the congressional branch; allows for the debate; allows for that engagement; allows for that understanding."
"Again, I am hearing from folks all over back home because they are worried."
"We already pay high costs for just about everything in Alaska, but they are worried what it is going to mean for groceries, for cars, for furniture, electronics, coffee."
We had a visit with a group of high school students on the steps yesterday and they were from all over the State.
You had some from Ketchikan all the way up to King Cove and out in the YK Delta.
And the first question from one of the 16-year-olds in that group was: Can you tell me what is going on with tariffs?
How is this going to impact us?
"You know, I really appreciated that question from that 16-year-old, who is paying attention to what is going on."
"He is here in Washington, DC, and he is figuring he is going to get some answers from his Senator."
They want to know that they have a voice in it.
"Now, it has been suggested—the President himself has issued a statement about this legislation."
He has indicated that he does not support it and that he would veto it.
"That is absolutely within his power, but we also have powers."
"We also have powers here in Congress, and we need to assert them."
So I would hope that this bill is maybe just the start—maybe just the toe in the water here where we are starting to see Congress reassert its authority.
"Because if we don’t stand up for the institution, if we don’t stand up for the legislative branch of our government by debating this issue and others, but holding votes, debating— let’s debate this."
Let’s have a vote on the Trade Review Act.
"Because if we just sit back, if we don’t assert our authority, we have only got ourselves to blame when we don’t like the direction that may be taken."
"The Executive has slowly arrogated more and more power since the end of World War II, and it has dramatically accelerated post 9/11, but we here in Congress have stood by, and we have accepted it."
We have said it is OK.
"I think it is time for Congress to reassert itself, whether it is on tariffs, whether it is on the power of appropriation, whether it is overseeing the bodies and the Agencies that we as a body have authorized."
Let’s remember our role is to legislate.
We owe that to those that we represent as well as to this institution for the long-term good of the Nation.
"Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a dear friend and public servant, Egbert Lawrence Davis III, who went home to be with his Heavenly Father on March 17, surrounded by his loving family."
Everyone who knew Lawrence knew that he loved God; he loved North Carolina; and he loved his country so much that he chose to dedicate his life’s work to serving the great State that he called home.
Lawrence served two terms in the North Carolina General Assembly as a State representative and two terms as a State senator.
"Throughout his career in public service, he served as the chair of the North Carolina Family Business Forum, the president of the Rotary Club of Raleigh, and a board member of the North Carolina Bar Association— just to name a few."
"But when asked what he would consider to be the highlight of his career, he said his marriage to his beloved wife Sandra Holderness."

"And most of all, Lawrence was known as a man of faith who led his life walking hand in hand with Jesus Christ."
"He was known by his church community as a beloved deacon, elder, Sunday school teacher, choir member, and Stephen Minister."
"He lived a life of quiet strength and unwavering faith, continually leaning on the Lord for guidance."
"Though he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on through his four devoted children, six cherished grandchildren, and beloved great-granddaughter."
"I would like to close by reciting a verse that was included in Lawrence’s obituary that I believe reflects the man he was to all who knew him, and it was from Micah 6:8."
"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good."
And what does the Lord require of you?
To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
The Senator from North Carolina. f AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF DESMOND BELLARD V.
"RONALD WYDEN, U.S. SENATOR Mr. BUDD."
"Mr. President, as if in legislative session and notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S."
"Res. 170, which is at the desk."
The clerk will report the resolution by title.
The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S.
Res. 170) to authorize representation by the Senate Legal Counsel in the case of Desmond Bellard v.
"There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution."
"Mr. President, this resolution concerns a lawsuit filed in the Oregon Supreme Court against Senator Wyden."
"That suit was brought by an individual, Desmond Bellard, who is representing himself without the assistance of an attorney and is attempting to use a civil action known as quo warranto to remove Senator Wyden from office for alleged State campaign finance violations in the 2022 election."
"This suit challenges the Senator’s right to be seated in the Senate, an issue which the U.S. Constitution commits exclusively to the Senate."
"This resolution would authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent Senator Wyden named as a respondent in this suit in order to remove the case to Federal court and seek its dismissal on the basis of the constitutional commitment to the Senate of the power to seat and remove its Members, the Speech or Debate Clause, and the lack of jurisdiction under Oregon’s quo warranto statute."
"I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BUDD)."
"Mr. President, it wasn’t that long ago that Sudan was on a path to recovery after decades of violence and civil war."
"Back in 2018, Sudanese citizens took to the streets to protest the conditions in their country."
"This movement pushed Omar al-Bashir, who was indicted by the ICC for a campaign of mass killing and rape, out of power, and this set the country on a course for a better future."
"Sadly, that future was disrupted when the military overthrew the civilian-led Government of Sudan."
"Then, 2 years ago, the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by General alBurhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, led by General Hemedti, plunged Sudan into war."
"In the 2 years since, over 150,000 people have died and 12 million more have been displaced."
You can see this poster reflects the results of what is happening in Sudan.
"In just 2 years, 12 million more people have been displaced and are in camps."
This is actually one of the nicer camps.
"With acute famine levels at historic highs, 30 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian aid."
You can see some of the Sudanese people with their dishes lined up to get some assistance.
"As so often happens during war, the impact has been especially devastating to women and girls."
"During raids by the armed factions, women and girls have been abducted and forced into sexual and domestic slavery."
One U.N. report found that gender-based violence skyrocketed by 288 percent last year.
"Again, you can see the impact."
"According to UNICEF, 221 children have been raped, including a case involving a 1year-old baby."
"If this is true, we just can’t ignore it as another horrific detail of a distant conflict."
"The world is watching, and we must hold the people who are perpetrating these acts accountable for their crimes."
The U.S. Government has determined that both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during fighting in Sudan.
And the Rapid Support Forces have led a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Darfur.
"In January of 2025, the U.S. Treasury Department took a positive step."
It sanctioned the leader of the Rapid Support Forces and the leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces for their armies’ lethal attack on civilians in Sudan.
But more needs to be done.
"Peace negotiations have stalled, and outside countries—the UAE, Turkey, Iran, as well as Russia and China—continue to send weapons to the factions."
"Well, because Russia doesn’t want to give up its port access to the Red Sea, China doesn’t want to abandon the nearly $6 billion of investments it has made in Sudan since 2005, and the UAE doesn’t want to abandon Sudan’s wartime gold trade."
"According to mining industry sources and research by Swissaid, nearly all of Sudan’s gold trade flows through the UAE."
The United States needs to stand up and say enough is enough.
"For people who say ‘‘Well, what difference does it make?"
That is a long way away from the United States.
"Why does it matter?’’ well, because, sadly, what happens in Africa, what happens in Sudan doesn’t stay in Sudan."
"If you can’t be outraged because of the moral horror of what is happening there, you should be outraged because the terrorism and the potential disease that can cross the borders of Sudan can come to the United States, and we have seen that too often in the past."
"As ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here in Congress as well as folks in the Trump administration because we must hold these groups accountable for their war crimes."
We must support them in ending the violence.
"Right now, both sides in the war continue to bomb, to raid, to siege schools, markets, and hospitals."
The Sudanese Armed Forces are intentionally denying humanitarian aid.
They are blocking medicine and other relief items.
The Rapid Support Forces continue to lead an ethnically charged campaign of violence in Darfur.
"Sadly, so many of the foreign assistance programs that we had in place have been ended or are under review."
"The United States, the Trump administration, and Congress must create a clear policy to address this conflict."
We must resume foreign assistance to the region and Sudan to limit further humanitarian suffering.
"We must set aside our differences, bring an end to the violence, and renew our commitment to setting Sudan back on the path to a civilian-led democracy."
NATIONAL DONATE LIFE MONTH Mr. GRASSLEY.
"Mr. President, this month of April is National Donate Life Month."
This month is the time to raise awareness about the lifesaving importance of organ donation.
"There are over 103,000 Americans on the national organ transplant waiting VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.017 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2543 April 10, 2025 list."
We should have confidence that our organ transplant system is efficient and fair.
"Sadly, my oversight dating way back to 2005 has uncovered decades of corruption and mismanagement in this donation system."
It has left vulnerable patients to die on waiting lists while unused organs from generous American donors go to waste.
"Speaking of waiting lists, I have been concerned about the reports of those on the waitlist being skipped over."
This furthers the distrust in the organ donation system.
"Through my bipartisan oversight and also the 2023 U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network law, the Federal Government is making longoverdue changes so that we take care and clean this mess up."
The law improved the management and the oversight of our organ transplant system and encouraged participation from competent and transparent contractors.
"To build onto those reforms, in March, the President signed a continuing resolution that provided authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to collect registration fees from organ transplant member institutions."
This ensures the 2023 law can be implemented properly.
I encourage all Americans to consider being an organ donor and understand the impact that it can have on saving lives.
"Of course, in addition to oversight of the new legislation, I am keeping my very close eye on how the Federal Government is implementing these new laws to give more people the chance of lifesaving transplants."
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mr. WICKER.
"Mr. President, actually, I am going to ask unanimous consent that we go ahead and confirm General Caine as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but I must say that I do so with mixed feelings."
"On the one hand, we need a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff immediately, and there is overwhelming support on the Democratic side and Republican side for this nomination."
"On the other hand, passage of this confirmation would pretty much end our week, and that would prevent us from getting a lot of work done later on this afternoon and into tonight and tomorrow if we have to stay until tomorrow to confirm this very important officer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
"So, in a way, we can have it either way, but, frankly, to stay here and get some Congressional Review Act resolutions done so that we can end a number of the pernicious regulations foisted off on the American people and on our economy by the Biden administration—that has a lot of appeal also."
"So with that in mind and in an effort to accommodate Members on both sides of the aisle who really believe we can finish our business today, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions filed yesterday on Executive Calendar Nos. 75 and 74, making Gen."
"John Caine Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, ripen at 3 p.m. today."
"Mr. President, I may have other unanimous consent requests, but if I could be heard on this matter for another moment, I would seek recognition for that purpose."
"Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend from Alaska, who has now vacated the floor."
I thought we had this more synchronized.
But let me say this: There was a vote earlier this week in the Armed Services Committee.
It passed the Armed Services Committee with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support—23 yeses and only 4 noes.
So there is really no reason to delay this any longer.
"Frankly, there is so much going on around the world with the four powers that constitute an axis of aggression to the United States that we really should give the President the choice that has been endorsed overwhelmingly by a bipartisan majority of the Armed Services Committee."
"With that, having communicated better now with my dear colleague from Alaska, I would yield to the junior Senator from the State of Alaska."
"Mr. President, I certainly hope my Democratic colleagues can let us move forward on this, or we are going to stay all night until we get the President’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs confirmed."
"Now, look, I know there was some concern about removing General Brown, CQ Brown."
I actually really like General CQ Brown.
I thought he did a good job.
I publicly stated a number of times that he served his country very well.
But here is the deal: The President of the United States is entitled to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that he wants.
"You look at history, senior military commanders on the Democrat’s side, on the Republican’s side—if the President doesn’t feel comfortable with them, he has the right to remove them and move on."
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.019 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2544 April 10, 2025 I happen to respect him a lot."
"He said: Hey, I am not comfortable."
I am moving to another Chairman.
"President Obama fired two very senior, four-star generals inside of 2 years."
"One was General McChrystal, one of the most seasoned warriors, you know, in a generation of warfighters, and he removed him."
So President Trump clearly had the authority to remove General Brown.
"He has now put forward General Caine, who, by the way—everybody on the Armed Services Committee thought he did a great job."
He is going to get a really big vote here.
So why are we delaying it?
It doesn’t make any sense to me.
The President deserves his senior military adviser.
That is what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is—his senior military adviser.
The President needs to feel comfortable with that person.
That person is actually out of the chain of command.
"We have seen throughout history that when the President doesn’t feel comfortable, he can remove one general and bring in another one."
That is what has happened here.
We should confirm General Caine immediately.
"I think he is going to do a really, really good job."
"As a matter of fact, I have interviewed, sat down with, served under hundreds of flag officers."
General Caine is one of the most impressive I have ever met.
So we need to get on with it.
"You know, there are these press stories about why President Trump removed General Brown."
"I think it is just because he wanted to have a general whom he trusts and feels comfortable with, and that is exactly his right as the Commander in Chief."
"General Caine is going to get a very, I think, significant bipartisan vote."
"And if the minority leader wants to object, we will just grind it out all night and get it done."
"Mr. President, I wonder if I could reclaim my time to ask my distinguished friend from Alaska a question."
"The Senator from Alaska has the floor, and he can yield for a question."
"Mr. President, I yield to my good friend from Mississippi."
"Mr. President, yes, that is correct."
"I would then ask my distinguished friend from Alaska: Isn’t it a fact that General Caine time and again has demonstrated his aptitude and leadership abilities while actually deployed in combat zones, leading servicemembers in Iraq and Syria, and while serving in various Special Operations forces units and also in the intelligence community and that he ran some of our most secretive programs for the security of Americans?"
"My good friend from Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, by the way—a Senator who knows probably more about the military than anyone else here—has it exactly right."
"General Caine has this breadth of experience, not just as a fighter pilot with thousands of hours, combat hours, in flight but has worked very closely with our intel services and has very significant combat experience in Iraq and Syria."
Very interestingly—and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows this—he has private sector experience.
You would say: Why does that matter?
It actually matters a lot because of our military and the need to integrate our very powerful private sector.
"So he brings a wealth of experience that, to be honest—in my 10 years in this position as a U.S. Senator on the Armed Services Committee and my 30 years in the Marine Corps, I have never seen a general that brings it all together."
So I think he is going to be outstanding and exceptional.
If the gentleman would further yield?
I just wondered if the gentleman would yield to the distinguished minority leader to ascertain how this matter is going to be resolved differently if we wait until tomorrow.
"Mr. President, I would yield to the distinguished minority leader."
"Maybe having him watch this distinguished debate between me and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has convinced him to bow to the inevitable, and that is the confirmation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs."
The Senator from Alaska has the floor.
The Senator from New York has not sought recognition.
"Mr. President, maybe the minority leader will explain why he is objecting given that we just laid out very cogent, strong reasons that we need to move forward on confirming the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff right now."
It is a very dangerous world.
I am curious on what the minority leader says.
I yield the floor if he has an answer.
Does the Senator yield the floor?
This Senator yields the floor to answer that inquiry that I asked about.
"Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum."
The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, I just want the American people who are watching this that care about our national security—the chairman of the Armed Services Committee just had a colloquy here on the floor talking about why we needed to move the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get confirmed in the Senate here."
"And I and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, respectfully, asked the question of the minority leader, Democratic minority leader, why are you blocking this?"
And you may have seen he just walked off the floor.
I don’t know if he has an answer.
"If he has an answer, it sure would be good to hear what the answer is because we need President Trump’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed."
"And I bet he gets strong bipartisan support, in terms of his confirmation, because he is very qualified."
"And yet, without any explanation, the minority leader of the U.S. Senate just said, ‘‘I object,’’ and he walked off the floor."
I hope the press reports on that.
That is kind of big news.
"And if we have to be here all night, jamming down on them to get the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed because our country needs it during a very dangerous time, a general who is immensely qualified, then that is what we are going to do."
"But it sure would be easier to just agree with us, start moving on the vote, and get this highly qualified general confirmed as President Trump’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs."
"But what you just witnessed, for anyone watching, the American people watching, was a nondebate."
My good friend from Mississippi and I were describing why we need to move this forward.
"The minority leader of the U.S. Senate, who has the power to do it, just said: ‘‘I object.’’ Normally, on the Senate floor when someone objects, they explain why."
But he didn’t want to do it.
He just walked off the floor.
So that is what we just witnessed.
"It is a little bit unusual, particularly when it comes to a confirmation that is so important."
There are very few confirmations that the U.S. Senate does that are more important than confirming the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"And I guess the Democrats are going to block it for now, and we will go all night to make sure President Trump has his principal senior military adviser, which he needs during these dangerous times."
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
"VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.021 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2545 April 10, 2025 The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll."
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, just for the information of Senators, as the unanimous consent request has been objected to, and we are not allowed to vote at this point to give the President of the United States a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I just wanted to inform the Senate, based on conversations with the majority leader and his staff, that there are two matters that we can and will proceed to later on this afternoon and perhaps into the night."
"The first would be the House version of Senator SCOTT of South Carolina’s Congressional Review Act resolution, H.J. Res. 61, providing for congressional disapproval under section 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rules submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘‘National Emission Standards For Hazardous Air Pollutants: Rubber Tire Manufacturing.’’ That is one matter that the objection has given us an opportunity to proceed to."
"The other would be Senator CURTIS’s Congressional Review Act, S.J. Res. 31, a joint resolution providing for the Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘‘Review of the Final Rule Reclassification of Major Sources As Area Sources Under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.’’ As I said, during my unanimous consent request, proceeding to the vote on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would give the President the advice and counsel that our Commander in Chief needs during a very dangerous time."
"That said, I made the unanimous consent request with mixed feelings because, frankly, there are two regulations—pernicious, onerous, needless regulations—by the Environmental Protection Agency that need to be wiped off the books."
So this will give us an opportunity to do that.
"It is 10 after 3 at this point, and I am not sure when the distinguished majority leader will schedule that, but Members should be advised that unless we are able to get a unanimous consent request and give the President his choice for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, those are items that can still be the order of the day, and perhaps there are other votes tomorrow."
"Mr. President, I join my colleague in expressing some frustration that we can’t vote on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
It is the kind of stuff that drives people crazy back home for an individual that is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
Most people back in my State of Oklahoma think this has already been done.
"But to not be able to move on this, to literally have my Democratic colleagues block it and say we are not going to allow the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for our military to be able to be there, it is just another one of those moments of Washington, DC, gridlock and frustration, especially when this person moved out of committee with a vote of 24 to 4."
There is just not controversy about this nominee.
"But now suddenly to be able to have a game, to be able to say we want to be able to stall this out and maybe block this person until after Easter, so we don’t have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is frustrating for people to say: Come on, just have the vote."
So I join my colleagues on the Republican side to say: What is the problem?
"Everyone knows this person is going to be voted on and is going to be approved because there is such wide bipartisan support, but for my Democratic colleagues to say: Nope, we want to drag this out for weeks, I just don’t think it is the right thing to do."
"Clearly, they disagree, but I don’t think it is the right thing to do. 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING Mr. President, next week, Oklahoma and the Nation will pause for a moment, and we will remember, nationally, for a moment, on April 19 at 9:02 in the morning."
"And some people will look around and go, ‘‘Has it been 30 years?’’ and other people will say: ‘‘What happened 30 years ago?’’ because it depends on your generation of when you were born and how old you were or if you were even alive in 1995, but if you were alive in 1995, you remember where you were when the news came out that there was an explosion at a Federal building in Oklahoma City."
"A man who was mad at the government and determined he was going to cause an uprising of people to take down the Federal Government pulled a Ryder truck in front of a Federal building, loaded it with diesel fuel and with ammonia nitrate, lit fuses, walked away, got in his car and drove away."
"As he drove away, behind him, the explosion went off that killed 168 people, including 19 children who were in the daycare center on the ground floor."
And our Nation was forever changed.
We pause every year still in Oklahoma.
"Every year, we think about those who were killed and those who survived and those who were changed forever."
"We remember every single year, as we will again this year on the 30th anniversary, and we will pause to remember."
"The people that are around us in Oklahoma are our neighbors, they are our friends, but many of them are also survivors or family members of survivors or family members of those who are lost."
There are still police officers and firefighters that have literally never been back to that location because it is too painful to be able to return to a spot where they carried out the bodies of their friends and neighbors.
There are individuals that their family was truly forever changed.
"And now, 30 years later, they still get together and talk and visit, catch up with each other."
"There are survivor networks that still engage and still keep in contact with each other, remembering what happens when out-ofcontrol anger took the lives of 168 people."
"On that sacred ground, there is still a quiet reflection pool."
There are 168 chairs there to remind people of the 168 lives.
"There is a phenomenal museum that is next to it that people come to literally from all over the world to study terrorism, domestic terrorism in particular, and to be able to walk through what happened in the crime scene and how it was so quickly resolved."
"We have law enforcement, first responders, families and communities that come from everywhere just to be able to learn and to reflect."
There are children that survived the daycare center that are now adults.
Let me give you two: Brandon and Rebecca Denny.
"Brandon was 3 years old, and he literally barely survived his injuries; in fact, doctors gave him a 10 percent chance of survival, but he did."
"As an adult, he works to still help and serve others."
"Rebecca, she was rescued from the rubble at 2 years old."
She now has a family of her own.
"She speaks powerfully, still, about forgiveness over bitterness."
They were some of those miracle babies that survived.
Many of the children around them did not.
"This past week, it was really a remarkable moment that a lot of people in this town probably missed, and I understand."
There is a lot of things going on right now.
"But on the south side of the Capitol, there was a spot of dirt that was dug up there and a group of Oklahomans, along with the Architect of the Capitol, buried a seedling tree."
"Now, that may not seem like a big deal on the Capitol grounds, but there aren’t many trees that are planted on the Capitol grounds."
"Many of the trees that are on the grounds are 100 years old or some, 200."
This is a great historic place and a spot of reflection.
"But in one spot there, we just planted a tree."
And you may say: What is the big deal about that tree?
"Well, if you are in Oklahoma, you already know the rest of this story, but I would like to be able to tell this body the rest of that story."
"On April 19, 1995, when that truck bomb explosion took place, it took 168 lives."
"Across the street was VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.023 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2546 April 10, 2025 the Journal Record Building; it just demolished a big section of that as well, blew out all the windows, destroyed it."
In the parking lot there in front of that building was an American elm tree.
It was a scrubby tree growing in a parking lot.
"If you have seen a tree in the parking lot, you know it is not usually the healthiest looking thing, but it was just growing there in the middle of the asphalt."
"But when the explosion happened, it literally destroyed all those lives."
"But for that tree, it blew literally every leaf off of that tree."
"But the force of the impact and the heat of the impact was so strong, that it literally turned the tree."
"The bark literally that usually has this nice little stripe as it grows literally has a turning point in it and around it, and everyone just assumed that tree is dead."
No one paid attention to it.
"In the year of the cleanup and all of the recovery and what was happening during that time period, no one paid attention to it, until the next spring, that scrubby little tree in the asphalt started sprouting."
And suddenly it went from being a scrubby tree in the parking lot that was just going to be cleared out to being a sign of hope.
So we cleared the asphalt and everything else away from it.
An arborist came and began to fertilize it and to take care of it.
"That scrubby little tree is now nicknamed ‘‘The Survivor Tree’’ now, and it is the picture of Oklahoma after that bombing."
That scrubby little American elm tree is now enormous 30 years later.
Its branches and its leaves spread out over that site.
"And on the morning of April 19, there will be survivors and families that will sit under its branches."
"And as we pause for 168 seconds and as we read the names of those who we lost, they will be underneath that Survivor Tree thinking again of: We survived."
"The term ‘‘the Oklahoma standard’’ was born during that time period as neighbor helped neighbor and as we cared for each other and the people who came to our home from all over the world, literally."
"If you walk into my office, you will see a picture of the Survivor Tree that is there."
How does that seedling that we just planted and that Survivor Tree connect?
"Well, that seedling is a daughter of that Survivor Tree."
"A seed was literally picked up off the ground under that Survivor Tree, was planted and grown, and now it is about 3 feet tall."
"That seedling, that daughter, we just planted 30 years later at the U.S. Capitol so that this Nation will never forget the out-of-control anger that turned to violence and hatred."
"It is our prayer from Oklahoma that, as people walk down the path outside, that they would stop and read the plaque beside that little seedling tree."
"That in the decades ahead, it will grow to be a giant American elm, just like its parent, the Survivor Tree, and that people would remember the lives that were lost, those who survived, and those who were changed forever."
That is why that tree was planted on the Capitol lawn this week.
"My simple request for my colleagues: April 19, it is a Saturday—when it comes, at 9:02 central time, would you just pause with us for just a moment and remember?"
Join us because we will absolutely never forget.
TRIBUTE TO JAY RAMRAS Mr. SULLIVAN.
"Mr. President, it is Thursday here in the U.S. Senate, and it is time for a great tradition—I think one of the greatest traditions in the history of the U.S. Senate."
"It is called ‘‘The Alaskan of the Week’’ speech, which I try to give most Thursdays."
"For the pages, this is the highlight of the week."
"Even our friends in the media like this speech because it usually signals the end of the work week, but not right now."
"You saw the minority leader’s objection without any explanation on why on confirming the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, so we might be here for a lot longer."
"So I wanted to highlight what is going on in Alaska, as I usually do during my ‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ speech and just give a snapshot of what is happening back home."
"It is still pretty cold, still have a fair amount of snow."
Anchorage just got a bunch of snow that lasted a couple of days.
The 53rd Iditarod just concluded in Nome with a stunning first-time win by Alaskan Jessie Holmes and his 10dog sled team.
"The Iron Dog Race, that is a snow machine race, longest, toughest snow machine race in the world, was won by—that is done in kind of tandem— Robby Schachle and Bradley George, their second victory of the Iron Dog snow machine race."
"Things are starting to thaw, as I mentioned."
"It is beginning of the summer tourism season, right around the corner."
"The first cruise ship will dock in Southeast Alaska in less than 2 weeks, and thousands of tourists from all over the world will come to our great State."
"Anyone watching in the Gallery, we would love to have you."
"For many of these tourists, this is going to be the trip of a lifetime."
"For Alaskans, this is where we live every day."
And our Alaskan of the Week does something that is very unusual: He is beloved by Alaskans and tourists—not an easy task—and this person is my friend Jay Ramras.
"Like many Alaskans, Jay is a jackof-all-trades."
He owns restaurants and beautiful hotels.
He has had a successful political career.
"And more importantly, he loves Alaska and especially his great hometown of Fairbanks—by the way, my wife’s hometown."
"Now, I love to talk about our Alaskan of the Week."
We have talked about hundreds over the course of many years here on the Senate floor.
Jay was born in Fairbanks in 1964.
"His father Dan moved to Fairbanks from Brooklyn, NY, in 1948."
And as Jay says: There has been a Ramras in Interior Alaska going on 80 years.
"And Jay’s entrepreneurial resume, which is legendary in Alaska, began in 1986 at the tender age of 22 years old when he started a chicken wing restaurant, expanding his business footprint to other eateries across Fairbanks and, eventually, purchasing the iconic Fairbanks landmark called Pike’s Landing."
"For anyone going to Fairbanks, you have got to stay at Pike’s Landing."
"It was this purchase that led Jay to uncovering some really incredible chapters of Alaskan history—as I said, Jay is a real history buff—and he credits this to his bachelor of arts degree in American history, but it all started with Pike’s."
Pike’s Landing was established after World War II when Lloyd Pike claimed land along the Chena River—the Chena River runs right through Fairbanks— under the Homestead Act.
"In 1959—by the way, the same year Alaska became the 49th State—Pike opened the original Pike’s Landing."
"Throughout the years, Pike’s Landing cemented itself as a landmark in the Fairbanks community."
"When Jay purchased Pike’s Landing in 2000, he found himself wondering about the history of the property and the man who established the landmark location of Pike’s."
The original owner had sort of disappeared from history.
"So Jay asked around, collecting oral histories from Fairbanks old-timers who had seen the growth of Pike’s Landing over the decades."
"Jay found that Pike’s Landing had long faced congestion at the boat launch due to its prime location right there, as I said, on the Chena River."
That was a problem Lloyd Pike solved by building a public launch to clear up some of the demand in terms of getting boats on the river.
The original boat launch was washed away when the Chena River flooded— huge flood by the way—in 1968.
"But decades later, Jay found himself building another boat launch, unknowingly, right at the same spot."
"As he said: If I hadn’t already been born, I would have believed in reincarnation."
I would have thought I had been reincarnated as Lloyd Pike because he put his boat launch right where Lloyd Pike lived.
"Since then, Jay has been working with Fairbanks North Star Borough Historic Preservation Commission to put Pike’s Landing on the National Register of Historic Places."
"I have no doubt that is going to happen. ‘‘It was so important to me that we rescue Lloyd Pike from obscurity,’’ Jay said."
"But this wasn’t the only historical figure that Jay has connected himself VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:49 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.024 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2547 April 10, 2025 and the community of Fairbanks to."
"As Jay was in the process of building an aviation-themed extension of his hotel, he felt it needed a real airplane mounted in front to honor the lodge’s proximity to the Fairbanks International Airport."
"While searching, he stumbled on a refurbished Cessna 140 on Craigslist."
"After purchasing this plane, Jay discovered it had been owned by none other than Noel Wien."
The Presiding Officer is a pilot.
Maybe he knows who Noel Wien is.
"For those who don’t, Noel Wien is considered the father of Alaska aviation—the first pilot to successfully fly from Anchorage to Fairbanks in 1924."
"Wien went on to found Wien Airlines, a commercial airline that operated in Alaska for nearly 60 years."
"As the Presiding Officer knows, these were some intrepid pilots."
"That was 100 years ago he did that first flight—openair cockpit, really cold."
"Jay’s interest in history, once again, piqued, and he dug into that period and discovered some great photographs of Noel Wien, Wien Airlines, and had a great celebration last year in July of 2024, celebrating the 100th anniversary of that historic flight in Alaska."
"Really, that was a historic flight for America."
My wife Julie and I were there.
"By the way, the Wien family was there, including Leslie Wien Hajdukovich, my former regional director."
It was a great classic Jay Ramras event.
"Hundreds of people came out to celebrate a huge moment in Alaska history, Alaska aviation history—I would say, American aviation history."
"In addition to preserving this incredible chapter in Fairbanks’ history, Jay has invested in Fairbanks’ future."
Let me tell you about a few of his other endeavors.
"Each summer, Jay hosts the Yukon 800 boat race, the longest, toughest, roughest speedboat race in the world."
"It starts at Pike’s, up to the Chena, gets out on the mighty Yukon— huge race."
"Just as I mentioned, he just recently hosted the fourth Iditarod start at Pike’s."
"Normally, the Iditarod starts down in Anchorage."
"That is the toughest, longest, greatest race in the world, the Iditarod."
"It occasionally starts in Fairbanks, but it did this year at Pike’s."
"And as I mentioned, he regularly sponsors the Iron Dog snow machine race that, yes, is the toughest, longest, roughest snow machine race in the world."
"Jay also had a successful political career, serving three terms in the Alaska House of Representatives."
And he is a great philanthropist in Fairbanks—a key player in Fairbanks Food Bank and doing so many other things in terms of philanthropy.
"On top of all this, Jay says his greatest legacy, he believes, will be something he recently did—which I think is just fantastic—the creation of a new synagogue in Fairbanks, the northernmost Chabad in the United States."
It began with a call from Rabbi Greenberg in Anchorage.
"He is a great friend of mine, one of the leaders of our Jewish community throughout the State."
He asked Jay if he could host a young orthodox rabbi and his wife for a short visit.
"Of course, Jay, a very generous man, agreed. ‘‘I think it would be around a two-week summer stay.’’ Then they came again for a second visit, this time in January when it is 45 below zero in Fairbanks."
It gets really cold in Fairbanks.
"The young couple, Rabbi Heshy Wolf and his wife Chani have now chosen to make Fairbanks their permanent home."
"Jay, generous as ever, purchased a small church with his own money."
The previous congregation at the church had outgrown the place.
"They refurbished it, transforming it into the Fairbanks Jewish Center."
"The original congregation stayed on rent-free until they found a new home, a new church."
"Just a few weeks ago, five rabbis gathered in Fairbanks for the first time in over 120 years and hosted this new synagogue, the northernmost synagogue, I believe, in America, in Fairbanks."
"What a legacy, not just for Fairbanks, but for all of Alaska."
"For every different community—sports community, Jewish community, historical community—you have done it all."
"And now, Jay, you have been awarded one of the most prestigious awards anyone can achieve in their life, Alaskan of the Week."
"CHINA Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to discuss a recent op-ed in the New York Times just a few days ago."
It kind of made a stir.
A lot of people thought it was a really good oped.
I wanted to come to the floor and talk about this op-ed because it is making the rounds.
"It is by the columnist Thomas Freidman, and it is on national security, economic security, and trade issues relating to China."
"Now, I normally enjoy, respect— don’t always agree with—the seriousness of Mr. Freidman’s writings."
"He has written a lot of books, a lot of columns, especially on the Middle East, where he has a lot of insights, no doubt about it."
But when I read this latest column called ‘‘I Just Saw the Future.
"It Was Not in America,’’ I couldn’t believe how shockingly naive Mr. Freidman was in writing this."
So I just wrote a response.
I just started writing after reading this thing.
"My goodness, this is very naive."
Then I submitted that to the New York Times.
"They said: Hey, sorry, it is too long."
Maybe they didn’t think it was that good.
"I said: I can just read it on the Senate floor because I think this is a big debate, our relationship with China, how we view it, how he views it, how others view it, how President Trump views it, and it needs to be debated."
"That is what I want to do the next couple of minutes, talk about the Freidman piece and, in my view, why it is so naive and misses so many things and, particularly, gives Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party a giant pass in terms of their history and what they have done to the international trading system."
"First, the Freidman article kind of condescendingly mocks, to be honest, a lot of us."
"He quotes some Senators, U.S. Senators, and says, you know, these Senators ‘‘need to get out more’’ when it comes to China."
That is a quote in the article.
"Well, in my career, I have actually gotten out to China a lot, I mean in terms of working on the Chinese issues."
"I served on the National Supreme Court Council Staff under Condoleezza Rice and served as her Assistant Secretary of State in charge of economics, trade, energy, and finance."
"Again, under Secretary Rice, I was the Commissioner in charge of natural resources and energy in Alaska."
"In all these positions, I met with Chinese leaders, traveled to China a fair amount."
"And, of course, China national security issues really bookended my entire 30-year Marine Corps career."
"My first deployment in the Marines was to the Taiwan Strait during what is now referred to as the ‘‘Third Taiwan Strait Crisis,’’ in 1995 and 1996."
My last billet in the Marine Corps was chief of staff to the Marine Forces Pacific Commander at Indo-Pacific PACOM.
It was all about China and Taiwan.
"As a Senator, I continued to focus on these issues, traveling to Asia frequently."
The lessons I learned when it comes to China are very different from those in the Thomas Freidman piece.
"As someone who has actually gotten out a fair amount to China, as Mr. Friedman tells us Senators we need to do, let’s go into some of these lessons."
"For a smart guy, they sure were kind of naive to me."
"First, Thomas Freidman talks about the need for an agreement between the United States and China."
But the big worry is that President Trump would not ‘‘stick by’’ any agreement with China.
"Now, he says this without even hinting at one of the Chinese Communist leadership’s most consistent, salient, and frustrating traits, and this is it."
"They, the Chinese Communist leadership, almost never abides by their agreements with the United States— and I mean never."
"Big agreements, small agreements, it doesn’t matter."
They never abide by their agreements.
I have seen this throughout my career.
"In 2003, I was actually in this meeting right there."
"Bush and the Vice Premier of China, Madame Wu Yi in the Oval Office."
I was a young staffer right there next to the President.
"And President Bush pressed her, Madame Wu Yi, on this theft of intellectual property that China does."

"Well, we all know what happened."
"For decades, they lied about that."
The last report USTR did on China’s theft of intellectual property rights from the United States was $600 billion a year.
"Madam Wu Yi lied to President Bush in the Oval Office, no doubt about that."
"I was also part of Secretary Rice’s senior leadership at the State Department, taking part in the twice-yearly Cabinet-level meetings launched by President Bush and China’s President Hu Jintao, called the Strategic Economic Dialogue."
They never kept any of their SED commitments ever.
This is what I refer to as ‘‘promise fatigue’’—promise fatigue.
"The United States makes an agreement with China, and they never keep it—never keep it."
You know who has made an art form out of promise fatigue and not keeping their promise?
You remember this in the Rose Garden with President Obama—in the Rose Garden 2015.
"President Xi Jinping looked at Barack Obama, looked at the American people and said: We are not going to do any more cyber theft, and we are not going to militarize the islands of the South China Sea."
That is what Xi Jinping told President Obama.
President Trump and then President Biden—Xi Jinping made commitments to both President Trump and President Biden: We are going to stop the importation of fentanyl into Mexico and the United States.
Xi Jinping said that to President Trump and to President Biden.
"Of course, during the Trump administration—in the first term—the phase one China deal was signed with all this fanfare in the East Room of the White House—I was actually there when that happened—and they never kept any of those commitments."
"So no matter what, when it comes to China, they just don’t keep their word."
And yet Tom Friedman’s article focuses on President Trump’s reliability?
"As Joe Biden would say, ‘‘Come on, man.’’ These are the guys who cheat and aren’t reliable at all, and we all know it."
"Second, Friedman highlights what he sees as a great opportunity with China as it relates to our economic relations."
"Yet he never mentions the overriding goal of this guy, Xi Jinping."
"That is to make sure the Chinese Communist Party stays in power and expands its power base at home and abroad through any means necessary, including coercion and violence."
This is the goal that we all know drives his decision making.
"Like many in the Senate, I frequently attend classified briefings on China."
"We just had the INDOPACOM Commander testify today, Admiral Paparo, who, by the way, is doing a great job."
"Make no mistake—it is in all the Intel briefings—this guy, Xi Jinping, is preparing for war in the Taiwan Strait."
Look at him there; he is in his fatigues.
His aggressive efforts might extend beyond that.
The Chinese military just completed another massive military exercise to not only blockade Taiwan but to stop any reinforcements from coming into Taiwan.
Then they conducted offensive military exercises off the shores of our allies the Philippines and Australia.
Their navy went all the way around Australia just a couple of weeks ago.
Friedman naively references Chinese Communist Party talking points: ‘‘healthy interdependencies’’ and ‘‘winwin.’’ These guys always use that ‘‘winwin’’ and ‘‘We will rise together.’’ Yet he ignores the military menace of the CCP abroad and its genocidal tendencies at home.
"Mr. Friedman says: Hey, there are a lot of smart people in China who can help us with AI."
I am a little more worried about that.
Then he notes: [Beijing] does not want a trade war.
"No, in fact, they are actually preparing for a real war, and that is a fact for anyone who knows about China."
"Finally, the entire thrust of Friedman’s piece builds on and reinforces one of the biggest strategic blunders that the United States has made with regard to China and our China strategy, over the past four decades, and that is outsourcing much of our national security to corporate America."
"Friedman argues that we should concentrate on letting both of our private sectors, in China and the United States, work together, and if we do that, ‘‘Americans, working in partnership with benevolent Chinese capital and technology, will prosper just like the Chinese benefited from American capital and technology in the last four decades.’’ And Tom Friedman has the nerve to call President Trump’s thinking ‘‘magical.’’ Well, this is really magical from Tom Friedman."
"First off, the Chinese communist system doesn’t really have a private sector."
"Again, anyone who gets out to China knows this."
"Everybody in China, ultimately, works for the CCP, for Xi Jinping, for the Chinese Communist Party."
"Just as importantly, as we have so painfully learned over the past four decades, the U.S. private sector, especially Wall Street and some of the big corporate CEOs, are very poor guardians of America’s national security and economic interests when it comes to China."
"The U.S. Government finally, during President Trump’s first term, started to say: Whoa."
We can’t outsource our national security to corporate America.
"We, the U.S. Government, need to safeguard our own interests, and that is what we are trying to do."
"I will say—and we just saw it a couple of years ago—the annual American CEO confab in Beijing with Xi Jinping, in the People’s Hall, which, in my view, has become a national embarrassment, with Xi triumphantly leading the sycophantic-looking American CEOs behind him, does nothing to dispel the concern that this remains a strategic weakness in our national security relative to China."
"As we speak, CCP—the Chinese Communist Party—propaganda is flooding the world to fan the flames of a narrative that Friedman seems to embrace, and it is this: Their narrative is that President Trump has broken the World War II liberal international trading system."
"This charge is ridiculous, and it gives a pass to the real culprit."
"The Chinese Communist Party broke the system a long time ago, and that has been their intention all along."
"In 2005, then-Deputy Secretary of State and future World Bank president Bob Zoellick delivered his well-received speech, called the ‘‘Responsible Stakeholder’’ speech."
"It noted that, more than any other country, China has benefited from the international economic order set up by the United States after World War II, and it was now time for China to safeguard and embrace and become a responsible stakeholder in this system to help it endure."
"I was in meetings with senior Chinese officials, not long after this speech, and they deceivingly used the term ‘‘responsible stakeholder’’ much to the American policymakers’ delight."
"But the CCP leaders clearly had other plans: to unleash policies that continued their rampant intellectual property theft of American businesses; to never keep their promises and commitments that they make to Americans; forcing U.S. companies to hand over proprietary technology in order to gain access to China’s market; aggressively subsidizing important industries, like steel, where they flooded global markets and destroyed the American heartland; blocking U.S. exports from having fair and reciprocal access to China’s market; and unleashing economic coercion on our allies, like Australia, Korea, and Japan, when they dared to question CCP orthodoxy."
The Trump administration’s policies are a course correction to all of this.
"But make no mistake, it was the Chinese Communist Party and its policies that took a wrecking ball to the international trading system."
"Yet, like so many other aspects of Friedman’s piece, he gives the CCP and Xi a pass on this most consequential point."

"It would be good progress if an insightful observer of the international system, like Thomas Friedman is, would do so as well."
"Mr. President, I was sitting with the CEO of one of America’s biggest and most influential companies last month, and I asked him a simple question: What could President Trump do that would be a bridge too far for you?"
What attack on democracy or the rule of law could Trump make that would cause you to speak up?
"His answer was pretty simple, and it was pretty confident."
"He said: If Trump were to ignore a Supreme Court ruling, that would cross the line."
"He was reflecting a familiar theme: that until President Trump thumbs his nose definitively at a Court ruling, then his attacks on democracy are troubling but not lethal."
"It is normal politics up until that dramatic confrontation between the executive branch and the judicial branch, for which the Constitution, as we know, really has no prescribed remedy."
"For many Americans, they may breathe a sigh of relief that America’s most influential private sector leaders would rise up to defend democracy; that if this confrontation that we worry about would come to pass, combined with a massive public mobilization, we could be saved."
But I didn’t breathe a sigh of relief.
I am deeply worried that we have really spent little time studying the paths that democracies take when they collapse.
"Most of the time, there is not a singular moment when the Executive dramatically seizes power."
There is not normally a brazen attempt to burn down the Parliament building.
"No, instead, democracies die when gradually, often quietly and methodically, over time, the structures that hold the Executive accountable for corruption, for thievery, for wrongdoing are dismantled—dismantled so that citizens can no longer hold the Executive accountable; dismantled so that the political opposition never has enough room to maneuver meaningfully."
The Executive doesn’t try to stuff the ballot box.
"Occasionally, at lower levels, the opposition still wins."
"But what happens is that those structures of accountability are either so degraded or so completely co-opted by the regime that the truth is just buried, and the political opposition loses the basic tools that it needs to win."
"In every democracy that stops being a democracy, then, there is a familiar story."
"There are four institutions that the regime attacks and that it attacks relentlessly until those structures of accountability are so disintegrated that, even though elections continue to happen, the same party or the same person wins power election after election."
"Those four institutions are the press, the legal profession, universities, and the business community."
"If you degrade or co-opt these four institutions, you never need to have a high-stakes fight with the top court in your country."
You don’t need to burn the Reichstag down.
"You can still have elections, but only one party will win."
"So that is why this CEO’s assurance, frankly, sent a chill down my spine— because our democracy isn’t at risk of dying; it is dying."
"As we speak, we are watching it die."
It is not too late to save it.
It is not too late to save our democracy.
But we can’t continue to close our eyes and think that our democracy can survive a coordinated assault on those four key institutions of accountability.
"Democrats and Republicans need to see what is happening before our eyes, rise up, and defend the independence of journalists, of lawyers, of universities, and of the private sector."
"So I want to spend a minute or two to walk you through what President Trump is doing and how it, frankly, chillingly, mirrors the tactics that other leaders have used to transition real democracy into pretend, fake democracy."
"It always starts with journalists, from Hungary to Belarus, to Venezuela—countries that have elections but elections where one party just keeps on winning."
"These are places where journalists are subject to a nonstop harassment campaign from the regime, such that people just stop doing journalism or journalists stop telling the full truth."
"Last month, for instance, Turkish President Erdogan locked up 11 journalists simply because they were covering protests against Erdogan’s jailing of the top opposition leaders."
"Now, Trump has not started jailing journalists, but the pace of harassment in the first 60 days of his second term is alarming."
"He has denied access to government buildings, including the White House, to journalists who don’t use preapproved language from the White House."
He is preferencing credentials to partisan journalists who simply parrot his party line.
His FCC has begun to deliberately harass media companies that are owned by political opponents of the President.
But Trump’s campaign to destroy independent journalism has a darker and more menacing side because Trump isn’t just trying to intimidate journalists so that they will be afraid to tell the truth; he is also trying to destroy the concept of truth itself.
"Again, this is a key facet of leaders who are elected who are trying to transition democracies away and into something very different."
"Well, that is why the Secretary of Defense looks into the camera and tells the American public that the text messages that everybody read, filled with classified information and war plans, did not include classified information and war plans."
"The White House wants you to believe that one plus one does not equal two any longer; that you should doubt even the clear things that you see with your eyes; that nothing is real; that nothing is true; that if you are a supporter of the regime and I tell you once plus one equals three, then one plus one equals three."
"That is also why the official position of the White House on key issues like tariffs changes every hour, because if the ground truth just changes constantly, then there is no truth at all."
Journalists are made to look foolish by reporting a true thing at 9 a.m. that becomes untrue at 10 a.m. Journalism loses its credibility when the facts being distributed by the White House change all the time.
Trump says the tariffs are permanent.
Journalists report that the President says the tariffs are permanent.
"An hour later, Trump says: I never said they are permanent."
They write that he is cutting deals.
"An hour later, they are suspended— no more tariffs."
"When the truth changes constantly, it is hard to believe that there is anything true any longer."
"Second, universities are always—always—a target of would-be autocrats."
"Again, in Tu¨ rkiye, the government has terminated thousands of professors just because they criticized the government."
"In Hungary, one of the nation’s most prestigious universities was forced to move out of the country because President Orban attacked it so ceaselessly for fomenting protests against his government."
"Universities, over the long history of democracy, have been the place where protests—especially youth protests— begin."
They are a thorn in the side of leadership.
"The famous Tiananmen Square protests in China were, of course, started by university students."
"So it is no surprise that if you want to crush democracy, you need to crush the independence of universities."
That is why Trump’s decision to target universities that permit criticism of President Trump is so bone-chilling.
"He pretends like he is standing up to antiSemitism on campuses, but what he is really trying to do is make clear that protests against his policies on campuses will result in Federal funding being cut off."
Columbia University was forced to agree to a stunning list of free speech concessions in order to gain assurances from President Trump that their Federal funding would continue.
They had to agree to allow campus police to arrest protesters.
"They had to essentially agree to receivership, Federal receivership, over an academic department VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:49 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.028 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2550 April 10, 2025 that houses professors who are critical of Trump and his policies."
"Effectively, the President of the United States got to pick the person who will oversee the Columbia Department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies as well as the Center for Palestine Studies."
That is not what happens in a healthy democracy— the leader of the country micromanaging academic departments at major universities to ensure that academic work aligns with the regime.
"Now, having successfully forced Columbia to bend the knee and quell dissent on their campus, Trump is targeting other universities."
Some of them will sign similar agreements giving President Trump power over those campuses.
"But, frankly, all Trump has to do is make an example of a handful of universities, and others will simply comply and obey in advance."
"As an academic president, when you have Federal dollars that employ people at your university, would you permit a major protest against a Trump policy if you know that is going to jeopardize Federal funds?"
"Maybe you allow it because you don’t want to brazenly stand in the way of free speech, but you just make sure that it is not too big a protest or it is not too critical."
You police speech to be on the right side of the regime.
"That is what happens in all of these fake democracies, and that is what is happening here."
But controlling speech on campuses is not enough.
Controlling and intimidating journalists is not enough.
You have to go after the lawyers too.
"Now, maybe there is not a lot of love for lawyers in this country, but lawyers are the ones who bring the lawsuits to stop the thievery and the illegality."
Lawyers are compelled by their oath to stand up for the Constitution.
Putin arrested Navalny’s lawyers right on the eve of Navalny’s trial.
"In Venezuela, Maduro routinely harasses and detains lawyers—human rights lawyers—because he knows those are the ones who will hold him accountable."
"In Tunisia, the regime stormed the offices of the bar administration to intimidate the legal profession into silence."
"Here in America, Trump is engaged in a shameless campaign of extortion against any major law firm that has taken a position against Trump or Trump’s interests."
"What he is doing is extraordinary, and it is mind-blowing to me that it is just being ignored by my Republican colleagues."
"He is going firm by firm—and not to every firm, just to the firms that have represented Democrats or brought cases against him—and he is telling them that if they don’t fall in line and stop doing work to oppose him, their clients will lose access to Federal work."
"This body, Republicans and Democrats, should stand up against it."
Several law firms have signed deals with Trump that obligate them to support— guess what—causes aligned with Donald Trump.
Paul Weiss was targeted by an Executive order and struck a deal.
They struck a deal with Trump before they had even been targeted.
"Already, collectively, these firms have pledged—think about this— about a quarter of a billion dollars of pro bono work to file cases in coordination with the President of the United States’ political interests."
"Just like what happened with the universities, there is a lot of extra compliance that is happening."
I know for a fact that firms that have already signed these agreements with Trump have gone above and beyond the terms of the agreements to quiet their criticism of the government.
"No doubt, every single major law firm will think twice before bringing an action against an illegal or corrupt action of the President in fear of Trump retaliating against their business."
The point is to try to crush dissent.
The point is to try to stand in the way of anybody who is going to hold Trump accountable by using the power—the official power granted to him by the people of the United States—to try to signal retaliation against anyone who dares oppose him.
But collective action can be a powerful tool.
"Together, the collective might of our universities and our law firms is significant."
"So they could choose to band together and decide to sign no agreements with Trump, to refuse to let the President of the United States dictate the terms of their speech, their business, their defense of the rule of law."
I don’t want to make the victim the perpetrator.
"This is all Trump’s fault, what he is doing to extort political loyalty from universities and law firms."
"But instead of there being collective action on behalf of these industries, the opposite is happening."
"In the legal profession, when Paul Weiss was being targeted, the other big firms didn’t rise to their defense; they started making calls to Paul Weiss clients and lawyers, using Trump’s assault as a means to poach business or partners."
"That is shameful, acting like ravenous vultures, putting your profits first instead of your country’s interests or the interests of the legal profession, which pledges before a court to stand up for the rule of law."
"Instead, these big firms are aiding and abetting the destruction of the rule of law by doing Trump’s work for him, making targeted firms even more vulnerable by working behind the scenes to strip them bare for parts."
"There are good, patriotic lawyers at many of these high-priced firms who know that this is wrong and they should speak up."
"Now, finally, Trump is coming for the rest of the private sector."
"Listen, I have no idea what the Trump tariff policy is."
The constantly shifting positions of the last week are an embarrassment.
It has jeopardized jobs and retirement savings and college funds all across this country.
"But the tariffs are complicated and convoluted and hard to understand, likely because they aren’t actually economic or trade policy; they are a political tool—this one designed to force every major company to come before Trump to plead for tariff relief in exchange for giving Trump the company’s political loyalty—no different than what is happening in the legal profession or in America’s universities."
"A tariff can be written very easily to favor one industry over another or one company over another, and the confusing nature of the tariff regime is a means for Trump to require every major company in the country to come on bended knee to him to get the relief they need."
"And that loyalty pledge could be anything—the purchase of some Trump crypto coin, public support for Trump’s economic policies, donations to his political campaign."
"But having watched what Trump has done one by one to universities and law firms, why would we assume the tariffs aren’t just simply a tool to do the same thing to big companies?"
What I am trying to say here is that you don’t need a battle royal between the President and the Supreme Court for democracy to die.
"If journalists are constantly looking over their shoulders and unable to report on the truth; if protest is suppressed, even moderately, at universities; if lawyers start giving cover instead of uncovering corruption and illegality in the regime; if companies start being mouthpieces for the regime as a price of doing business—if all that happens, then we are not a real democracy anymore; we are a fake democracy."
"Elections still happen, like in Tu¨ rkiye, like in Hungary, like in Venezuela, but the rules are going to be tilted, and dissent will be suppressed so much that the same side—Trump’s side—wins over and over and over."
"This should matter not just to Democrats, not just to members of the minority party; this should matter to Republicans as well."
"We swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, and it is time for us to see the game that is being played."
The good news is that the rules have not been fully rigged yet.
"There is still time—not loads of it, but there is still time for this body to set a tone that causes the kind of massive public outrage necessary to stop this campaign of destruction in its tracks."
But that requires those of us who believe that the threat to democracy is urgent to act like it.
"That means saying to our Republican colleagues that we are not going to act like business as usual, that we are not going to proceed to legislation unless we have agreement, Republicans and Democrats, to stop this assault on free speech and dissent."
It requires the minority party to say that right now.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, with respect to the cloture motions on Executive Calendar Nos. 74 and 75, the mandatory quorum calls be waived and they ripen at 1 a.m., Friday, April 11; further if cloture is invoked on Calendar No. 74, all postcloture time be expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; further, if cloture is invoked on Calendar No. 75, all postcloture time be expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; finally, if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table."
"Without objection, it is so ordered."
BUILDING RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITIES PROGRAM Mr. CASSIDY.
"Mr. President, what you see depends on where you sit."
"Last Friday, it was announced that the BRIC Program, or the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, run by FEMA would end, and money which had been allocated would be pulled back from the States which were receiving it."
"Now, most families across the country have not heard of the BRIC Program, but if you were to explain what it does, they would say, oftentimes, that they need it."
I can tell you folks in Louisiana do.
"Louisiana has benefited the most per capita in the BRIC’s latest round of funding, and I would argue that this actually saves tax dollars for the rest of the country because the BRIC Program helps prevent against flooding, flooding that may occur after a big rain event or after a hurricane."
"And in Louisiana and in many parts of our country, this is an inevitable part of life."
But the best way to recover from a flood is to never flood at all.
The old saying: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Another: A stitch in time saves nine.
The same principle applies to flood resilience and mitigation infrastructure.
"When we invest in levies and floodwalls, communities are protected when the storm hits, and the Federal Government saves billions in a recovery effort that never has to be done."
"If you go down to South Louisiana, for example, you will see homes elevated by the BRIC Program that were not previously elevated."
"Now that they are elevated, that family is secure should the floodwaters come."
"Now, you can say: Wait a second."
"There is a parish in Louisiana in which the flood control structures prevented 10,000 homes from being flooded in the last hurricane—talk about an ounce of prevention because those programs, those families, they would have received Federal help."
Turns out no Federal help was needed because we were able to build resilience.
We were able to keep those homes from flooding in the first place.
This is the type of work that we need to do.
"And if we do it, then never is a National Flood Insurance Program claim filed."
The family saves; the taxpayer saves.
Investing now saves money down the line.
"That is why back in 2018, during President Trump’s first term, Congress established the BRIC Program to invest in those flood protections needed to prevent future flooding."
"And through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, another billion dollars was added to that program."
"This is because the BRIC Program is an effective tool, the type of tool that my communities in my State and communities elsewhere in the country depend upon."
"Now, apparently, though, the BRIC Program is in danger."
"And it is being endangered, I gather, because of the effort to eliminate government waste."
"Now, there is a lot of government waste, and I am all for eliminating that waste."
"If there is fraud, we should eliminate it."
"If there is waste, we should eliminate it."
"But preventing homes from flooding, that if they do flood will cost the Federal taxpayer billions of dollars, that is not waste; that is good planning."
"That is what we should all be doing in every aspect of our life: planning ahead, planning proactively."
"The waste is that, if we don’t do this program and the inevitable flood occurs, then we have to go in and rescue communities."
That is waste because we could have prevented that from happening in the first place by implementing programs such as the BRIC Program.
I would ask FEMA to reconsider the impact of cuts to the BRIC Program and to reconsider canceling the BRIC applications that are already placed.
This is a congressionally authorized piece of legislation— authorized and congressionally appropriated.
Congress has said that this program will exist.
"To do anything other than to use that money to protect families from flooding, to protect the Federal taxpayer from having to put out billions to rescue communities which have flooded, is to thwart the will of Congress."
"And that is why Congress passed it in the first Trump term, and that is why President Trump supported it."
"It improves efficiency, not decreases it."
"I can tell you, people in South Louisiana—whether it is Terrebonne, Lafourche, Ascension Parishes, and places you wouldn’t expect to flood like Livingston Parish—that overwhelmingly—that supported President Trump 95 percent of the time, they would overwhelmingly support this sort of flood mitigation."
"Here are some examples of the money that is already going out: Roughly, $40 million to the city of Central; $36 million to Ascension Parish."
"In Central, they were trying to reduce flooding after the great floods of 2016 in Louisiana, trying to keep that from happening again."
The $36 million to Ascension Parish is to fortify electrical infrastructure.
Hurricane comes along; electricity goes out.
"Of course, no electricity, the whole community is incapacitated."
Twenty million dollars to Lafourche Parish to strengthen 16 miles of power lines; $10 million to the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana to provide evacuation routes during flooding.
"Evacuation routes during flooding, that is something that we should make sure we are building so that you don’t have to helicopter people out or you don’t have to get them out by boat."
So these are examples of BRIC Programs that are a stitch in time that will save nine.
"Now, of course, it is important to my State."
I will point out that Louisiana was the third largest recipient of BRIC Program funding recently and the largest on a per capita base.
"And without BRIC funding, none of these projects would happen—whether it is East Baton Rouge Parish, Ascension Parish, Lafourche, or the Coushatta Tribe."
Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson had a $25 million application for grid-hardening so that the people of Lafourche would be able to get back on their feet quicker after a hurricane.
"I can tell you, I went down to Lafourche Parish after the last hurricane, and all the power poles had just toppled over."
It is almost as if you were playing dominoes.
"They weren’t touching, but they all toppled just like that."
And there were crews from around the country that had been—electrical crews that had been mobilized to come and reinstall those.
"If you hardened the grid, that doesn’t happen."
"If you harden the grid, those tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars spent to get those electricity poles back up does not have to be spent."
This money is an investment in a more resilient future that doesn’t require the investment of private and public capital to restart communities.

They would also tell you that this is not waste.
"This is something which will save their homes, save lives, and save communities."
"Now, we can ask ourselves if FEMA were to move forward with the plan to cut BRIC, what would be the alternative?"
"Flooding costs up to almost $500 billion in damage every year throughout the United States, not just Louisiana."
"Again, $500 billion in damage that we have to pay after the fact versus investing a few million now to prevent."
"Now, the darker the color, the more the recent flooding."
"So you can say, although I have been speaking about Louisiana, you can see that, across our Nation, floods have been destroying homes and neighborhoods; downing power lines; harming businesses; in some cases, taking lives."
"Just since the start of 2025, at least eight Americans in these four States in dark red have died as a result of storms hitting their communities."
"In the last 3 months, 37 States have experienced flooding."
These are the States that are in red.
"It goes all the way from Maine to Minnesota, to Michigan, to Montana—you don’t think of Montana being a flood State—Idaho."
All of these States in red have had flooding in the last 3 months.
"And you see, it is not just the coastline in which there is a coastal surge like Louisiana or Florida."
"It is also what is called riverine. ‘‘Riverine’’ meaning you have a valley, a river down the middle, the river rises, and people on the lower part of that valley—I think that would be the situation in Kentucky—are going to flood."
"These are all places that could benefit from a resiliency program, from a BRIC Program."
"And just to bring this home to my State, this is Livingston Parish, LA, just after the great flood of 2016."
These are homes in areas that had never flooded before.
"And in some incredible, once-in-500-years flood event, they were all flooded."
"Livingston Parish, 2016—we call it the Great Flood."
"It affected not just this parish but all those in what we call the capital region—Tangipahoa Parish, going up to Monroe, LA—it was almost a statewide event."
"Now, if we built resiliency, this doesn’t happen."
"If you look at this, can you image the Federal response?"
They were so honored then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump came down and spent time in Livingston Parish after this flood to call attention to it because he felt as if President Obama was not paying attention.
"President Trump came with Vice President nominee Pence, spent time there, brought hope to the people, and that is when, in 2018—I am sure part of his motivation was to sign into law what has ultimately become the BRIC Program."
These people testify with their flooding how lives are changed when you don’t have resiliency.
I just want to say one more thing because I would talk to these people.
I am privileged to represent them.
Each of these homes has a story.
"There was a wedding dress that a mother had, saving for her daughter, that was ruined in a flood."
"There were wedding pictures from a grandparent, parents, and daughters—multigeneration—and an album to save for generations totally lost in a flood."
"There were, in this flood, neighbors who went out and died, not recognizing the place they were stepping wasn’t the side of a road but rather a ditch, and they went down, got swept away in this flood."
I can go through each house and imagine a story that could have been prevented if there had been resiliency built into this community before this flood.
"The purpose of the BRIC grants is to build that resiliency so that we don’t have stories to tell which are tragic or sad but rather stories where people continue on with their life as if—well, as if the flood never occurred."
Local leaders advocating implementing using these dollars are advocating for the people they represent.
"Right now, representing those people calls for me to ask that any effort to stop BRIC grant funding is halted, that the will of Congress, that the law that Congress passed, that the funding Congress put into the program, that be honored—by law, it should be honored—and that the money which is out there stays there and the applications which have been placed be accepted, processed, and fulfilled."
"If rules need to be changed because the Biden administration did things which are silly to have done, then change those rules."
"But to end a program—to end a program—which has the ability to prevent this sort of disaster, not just in my State but across the Nation, we should not end that program."
To do so is to inflict harm both upon the rule of law and upon these communities.

"For almost half a century, every U.S. President has proclaimed the Rebbe’s birthday as Education and Sharing Day in recognition of his unwavering commitment to improving education for all people."
"Throughout his decades of dedicated service and leadership, the Rebbe emphasized that education must go beyond the transfer of knowledge."
"It must instill the values essential for living a meaningful life, nurturing moral character, and contributing to the betterment of both individuals and society as a whole."
"The Rebbe held a deep appreciation for America’s unique role as the world’s superpower, and he maintained meaningful relationships with many national leaders, who saw him as a VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.044 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2554 April 10, 2025 moral guide."
"He often pointed to the words ‘‘In God We Trust’’ enshrined on our currency—which is also inscribed above the doorway into the Senate Chamber—as a reflection of the American story, a nation founded on faith and moral responsibility."
"For the Rebbe, America was not just a great country but a beacon of light with the historic potential to inspire renewed moral clarity among all of humanity."
"Under his visionary leadership, Chabad-Lubavitch became the largest Jewish educational organization and the fastest growing Jewish movement in the world."
"Today, there are more than 5,000 Chabad-Lubavitch centers offering educational, religious, and humanitarian services in 103 countries and in all 50 States, including in my home State of South Dakota."
The Rebbe envisioned a world at peace.
"He exemplified how humanity— through moral education, acts of kindness, and charitable deeds—can bring about the prophetic era when ‘‘swords are turned into plowshares’’ and peace and prosperity flourish across the earth."
"On the Rebbe’s birthday, it is fitting that we recommit ourselves to his legacy and teachings, striving to live with greater compassion, deeper purpose, and a shared sense of responsibility for the good of all. f RECOGNIZING NATRONA COUNTY CDC’S ART A LA CARTE GALA Mr. BARRASSO."
"Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Child Development Center of Natrona County as it celebrates the 25th anniversary of its largest fundraiser, the Kids’ Art a la Carte Gala."
"On May 3, 2025, the Natrona County Child Development Center will host its annual fundraiser at the Ford Wyoming Center in Casper, WY."
Proceeds from this special event go directly toward supporting the CDC’s services and programming.
"It is a wonderful opportunity for the community to share its support for the CDC’s important mission: providing premiere, family-focused, developmentally appropriate services for Wyoming’s kids."
The child development center opened its doors in 1967.
"Over the years, the CDC has helped to ensure that the social, developmental, and educational needs of the children in our communities are being met."
"Today, this organization, led by executive director Alisha Rone, serves close to 700 children each year."
"Its team of 120 individuals provide support, advice, and— when needed—intervention to parents and their children."
The CDC’s early intervention services are key to ensuring the lifelong success of our children.
"Offering free screenings and educational materials, the CDC provides children in Natrona County with a solid foundation."
The center’s certified teachers and therapists help provide a plan tailored to every child and their needs.
Its accredited preschool prepares kids ages three through five for kindergarten.
"For children who need extra assistance, there is the CDC+ program."
"In addition to providing speech, occupational, and physical therapies, the program offers audiology services and reading coaching."
"The teachers, therapists, support staff, and leadership continue demonstrating selflessness and compassion."
"This year, the CDC received the Daniels Fund Medal of Excellence and a $250,000 grant."
The grant will fund its continued operations and expansion of its services at no cost to participating families.
Providing the excellent service the CDC is known for takes a team of talented people.
"This team includes the CDC’s senior leadership, board of directors, foundation board, and dedicated employees."
"The Child Development Center’s Senior Leadership team includes: Alisha Rone, executive director; Lori Kapeles, program director; Jan Hinz, special education director; Geoff Dean, finance director; Shannon Hillibush, human resources director; and Renate Pullen, compliance director."
"Members of the CDC Board of Directors are: Bryce Row, president; Michelle Larsen, vice president; Patricia Cloud, treasurer; Anna Birch DeWitt; Tayla Trujillo; Ally Orr; Nikki Hawley; Scott Wells; Tony Hager; Bobby Pickle; Brad Diller; and Fleur Tremel."
"Those serving on the CDC Foundation Board include: Mark Zaback, chairman; Jeff Bishop, treasurer; Robyn Landen; Shannon Orr; Peter Van Houten; Pete Fazio; Isaac Swanson; Dave Dundas; and Alisha Rone."
"Mr. President, it is an honor celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Child Development Center of Natrona County’s annual Kids Art A La Carte Gala."
The positive impact the CDC has made on the families and children of our community is genuinely remarkable.
I offer my appreciation for all those who support the CDC.
Your efforts ensure children in Wyoming have a strong foundation to prepare them for a lifetime of success. f REMEMBERING ROYCE POLLARD Mrs.
"Mr. President, Mayor Royce Pollard, a dedicated public servant and champion for Vancouver, WA, passed away on February 24, 2025."
"Before his time in local government, Mayor Pollard led a distinguished career in the U.S. Army that included two tours during the Vietnam war."
"During his nearly 27 years in the military, he attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and numerous awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star for Valor, Purple Heart, Expert Infantryman’s Badge, and Combat Infantryman’s Badge during his time in Vietnam."
"His final post was at the Vancouver Barracks, where he retired as commander in 1988."
"His dedication to public service was immediately on display as he joined the Vancouver City Council the following year, beginning a 21-year career serving the citizens of the city of Vancouver."
Mayor Pollard served on the city council for 7 years and then as mayor for 14 years.
"During his tenure, Mayor Pollard revitalized Vancouver’s downtown core, transforming it into a vibrant center of community and commerce."
The revived Esther Short Park and the beautiful waterfront development stand as enduring symbols of his bold leadership and love of community.
"He also oversaw the annexation of the Vancouver Mall, the creation of the Hilton Hotel and Convention Center project, and the historic Cascade Park annexation."
"Mayor Pollard was a proud champion of ‘‘America’s Vancouver,’’ a move to make the city distinct from Portland, OR, just across the river."
"He was so committed to the cause that when he smashed two Portland-themed mugs sold in Vancouver at a coffee shop, newspapers around the Pacific Northwest ran the story."
"In Washington, DC, he was known to talk to people unfamiliar with his city and tout its many attributes."
"Even after his tenure as mayor, he continued to help the community grow and thrive by serving on 22 different city boards."
"He was a strong and vocal advocate for civic duty, serving one another, and honoring those who serve their communities."
"His contributions have left a lasting impact on the city, cementing its place as a vibrant and forwardthinking community."
"My heart goes out to the mayor’s family, friends, and all who had the honor of knowing and working alongside him."
"I was proud to work with him on behalf of his community, and he will be missed."
His life’s work will be felt by generations to come.
"In honor of Royce’s life and legacy, I respectfully submit this statement to the RECORD. f TRIBUTE TO DOW CONSTANTINE Mrs."
"Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commend the distinguished public service of King County executive Dow Constantine, who concludes 16 years of exemplary leadership at the helm of King County government."
"Since first taking office in 2009, Executive Constantine has dedicated himself to the advancement of King County and the well-being of its more than 2 million residents."
"Over the course of four terms, he has consistently demonstrated a profound commitment to public service, principled leadership, and effective governance."
"Under his tenure, King County emerged as a national leader in environmental sustainability, public health innovation, and equity-focused policymaking."
"Executive Constantine spearheaded ambitious initiatives to combat climate change, expand regional transit, preserve open space, and reform the VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.040 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2555 April 10, 2025 criminal legal system."
"His leadership during the COVID–19 pandemic was particularly noteworthy—marked by decisive, science-driven action that helped protect lives and support vulnerable populations during an unprecedented public health crisis."
"Executive Constantine also led efforts to strengthen behavioral health services, invest in affordable housing, and promote inclusive economic growth."
"His ability to bring together stakeholders across sectors and jurisdictions has left a lasting impact not only on King County, but on the broader Puget Sound region."
"Throughout his 16 years in office, Executive Constantine upheld the highest standards of public service, always placing the needs of his constituents at the center of his work."
"His forward-thinking approach and unwavering dedication have left King County stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future."
"As he concludes his service as county executive, I extend my deepest gratitude to Dow Constantine for his many years of outstanding leadership and his tireless efforts on behalf of the people of Washington State."
I wish him continued success as the new CEO of Sound Transit. f H.J. RES. 20 Mr. GRAHAM.
"Mr. President, the following Senators join me in this statement: TIM SCOTT, BILL HAGERTY, MARSHA BLACKBURN, THOM TILLIS, TED BUDD, and JOHN BOOZMAN."
"The day after Christmas, when both Houses of Congress were in recess, the Biden administration released a final rule setting new energy efficiency standards for tankless water heaters."
"Like any last-minute rule from the previous administration, this effort was ill-advised and ill-timed."
"It should not, and cannot, stand."
"However, the enactment of H.J. Res. 20, which provides for congressional disapproval of the rule titled Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer GasFired Instantaneous Water Heaters, will create a structural imbalance."
"This imbalance results from the Biden administration’s issuance of an efficiency rule for commercial tank and tankless water heaters in October of 2023, as well as residential tank-filled water heaters in April 2024, neither of which could be overturned by the Congressional Review Act because it was unlikely to achieve a veto-proof majority in the Senate."
"Through rulemaking, the Department of Energy should write new rules to address this regulatory imbalance, whereby traditional tank water heaters and commercial gas-fired instantaneous and tank water heaters continue to be subject to regulatory standards."
"This structural imbalance, if not addressed, will result in an uneven competitive marketplace for water heater manufacturing and sales."
"While the enactment of the resolution may limit the Department of Energy from issuing a substantially similar rule, there remains a need to rectify the regulatory misalignment."
"Accordingly, we strongly encourage the Department of Energy, with input from congressional leaders and affected industry partners, to use its rulemaking authority to ensure that regulatory standards for consumer and commercial gas-fired water heating equipment are aligned, thereby removing any market imbalance. f CONFIRMATION OF MARK MEADOR Ms. KLOBUCHAR."
"Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Mark Meador as a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)."
I respect Mr. Meador’s qualifications and his prior experiences.
"In fact, I voted to advance his nomination out of the Commerce Committee because he has expressed support for strong antitrust enforcement that benefits consumers and small business, lowers prices, and spurs innovation, including continuing many cases currently ongoing at the Commission to free markets from the stranglehold of entrenched monopolies and stop anticompetitive mergers."
But I cannot support the confirmation of any additional members to the FTC until Commissioner Slaughter and Commissioner Bedoya are reinstated.
"President Trump’s dismissal of Commissioners Slaughter and Bedoya is not only illegal; it hurts consumers and small businesses by undermining the independence of the Agency that Congress established to protect consumers from fraud, scams, and monopoly power."
An independent FTC is critical for protecting consumers and has done so in a bipartisan manner for over 110 years.
"Just last year, the FTC returned more than $330 million to consumers who lost money from scams and deceptive business practices; it blocked a merger of two large grocery chains that would have raised food prices; it worked to cap the cost of inhalers to $35 by challenging anticompetitive patent practices; it took on hidden fees in the ticketing and lodging markets; it unveiled rules to make it as easy to stop a subscription as it was to start it; and it has worked to rein in the monopoly power of Big Tech companies to ensure small businesses and innovators can thrive online."
"The President’s attempt to remove independent Commissioners violates Congress’s long-held power to establish bipartisan, multimember, expert commissions and to shield those commissions from political pressure with commonsense limits on the President’s removal powers."
"The structure of the FTC has been upheld by the Supreme Court for 90 years, holding that Congress’s power ‘‘cannot well be doubted.’’ While the Supreme Court recently struck down restrictions on the President’s authority to remove Agencies led by a single individual, the Supreme Court declined to revisit precedent about independent Agencies run by bipartisan, multimember commissions, like the FTC."
"Now-Justice Kavanaugh, while serving on the DC Circuit, wrote that multimember independent Agencies like the FTC are part of a ‘‘deeply rooted tradition’’ that ‘‘has been widely recognized by leading judges, congressional committees, and academics.’’ This is because bipartisan commissions allow Presidents to shape the direction of a commission while protecting the independent Agency from political meddling."
"For example, each President can influence the makeup of the FTC by nominating new members— as President Trump has done by nominating Mr. Meador—and appointing the Chair—as President Trump did by selecting Mr. FERGUSON—and even appointing a new Chair if the President is displeased with his initial selection."
"Had the President not taken this illegal action, Republican Commissioners would have secured the majority on the Commission with the confirmation of Mr. Meador, with two Democratic Commissioners serving in the minority as required by law."
"While the minority Commissioners may not have had the power to stop the Republican majority from implementing its agenda, they would have served as a critical check on the Agency, as minority Republican Commissioners have in the past."
"They could have used their dissenting voices to hold the Agency accountable for any action that didn’t serve to lower prices, protect consumers, or even the playing field for small, innovative businesses."
"If necessary, they could have pointed out corruption or backroom dealings."
And they would have been able to change the Commission’s course on specific actions by persuading a Republican Commissioner to join them.
"But if the President is allowed to unilaterally dismiss Commissioners, even Republican Commissioners would be powerless to stand up to the White House if ordered to take an illegal action at the expense of consumers because the President could fire them as well."
"Ultimately, removing the FTC’s mandate to act independent of political pressure to protect consumers serves to harm those most in need."
Only those who have political influence with the White House stand to gain.
We have already seen some of the ramifications of the chaos wrought by these illegal firings.
"In a case about insulin pricing, there were no remaining Commissioners to hear the case because the two Republicans were both recused."
"This led Chair FERGUSON to ‘‘unrecuse’’ himself, making him the sole decisionmaker in a matter in which he has a known conflict of interest."
"And last week, it was reported that multiple members of DOGE are now embedded in the Chair’s office, raising the specter that the FTC may face cuts just as it is gearing up to take Meta— one of the world’s richest companies— to trial this upcoming Monday for buying up competitors to dominate social VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:46 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10AP6.038 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2556 April 10, 2025 media markets."
None of this helps small businesses.
None of this lowers prices or spurs innovation.
"Until these illegal firings are reversed, I cannot support Mr. Meador’s nomination to the FTC. f TRIBUTE TO TIM PENNY Ms. KLOBUCHAR."
"Mr. President, I rise today to honor Tim Penny, a public servant, former colleague, and friend who is retiring after a lifetime of service to the State of Minnesota."
"Tim grew up on a family farm in southeastern Minnesota, served in both the Minnesota State Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and has spent the past 18 years leading the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation as president and CEO."
Tim has been with me on many visits across southern Minnesota.
"Whether it was helping the community of Madelia recover from a devastating fire or to expand early childhood education, Tim’s love for the people of Minnesota has always shined through."
"To quote Tim, ‘‘I am always in awe of the accomplishments of small-town residents when they are provided the resources to realize their ambitions.’’ And his work helped turn those ambitions to revitalize communities into reality."
Tim began his public life as a State senator in 1976.
"Six years later, he was elected to represent Minnesota’s First Congressional District in the U.S. House, where he served for 12 years."
He gained a reputation for his principles and independence.
"Tim’s commitment to transparency and honesty in government were central themes in the three books he wrote about his Washington experience: ‘‘Common Cents,’’ ‘‘Payment Due,’’ and ‘‘The 15 Biggest Lies in Politics.’’ Talking about that book, he said, ‘‘We elect people to achieve the common good and when you get bogged down and paralyzed by mindless sloganeering you don’t end up with the sort of consensus that moves policy forward.’’ He carried those values and commitment to the common good to the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation and in all his other work in the community."
He was a senior fellow at the Humphrey Institute and also worked for the public affairs firm Himle Horner.
"Tim is cochair of the Economic Club of Minnesota, cochair of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and serves on the Board of Parent Aware for School Readiness."
"Tim, thank you for your work at the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation and through your many years representing our State in Washington."
Minnesota is better because of you.
I wish you all the best in your retirement.
"Mr. President, Faith Month is designated every April, bringing together people of faith in prayer, thanksgiving, and celebration of their faith."
"I embrace this special month and commend Concerned Women for America, the Nation’s largest public policy organization for women, and other faith-based organizations for encouraging people to use this month to actively strengthen their faith."
"Religion is often viewed as a controversial topic, but without religious faith, there would be no United States of America."
Faith is deeply woven into the fabric of our great Nation.
It was a commitment to faith that led the Pilgrims to flee religious persecution in Europe and seek freedom in a new land.
"They were followed by Roman Catholics, Baptists, Quakers, and Calvinists, all seeking the chance to practice their faith free from the bonds of a tyrannical government."
The Christian faith profoundly shaped the culture and politics of Colonial America.
Faith also inspired our struggle for independence.
"As our founding documents declare, we are ‘‘endowed by [our] Creator with certain unalienable Rights,’’ and our government is founded on ‘‘the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God.’’ Acknowledging our ‘‘reliance on the protection of divine Providence,’’ we could not be ruled by a King or taxed by a Parliament without consent."
"America’s Founders created the first Nation in history not based on shared ethnicity or language, but rather on the belief that God grants every human being inherent value and natural rights."
The Founders worked to protect the religious freedom sought by the first Colonists.
"They enshrined that freedom in the very First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as ‘‘the free exercise thereof.’’ They did not want the state to be separate from the church as a means to free the state from faith, but to guarantee that Americans could worship freely and as they chose."
"A nation founded on inalienable, God-given rights could not ignore the importance of belief in God."
The Founders also understood that faith was an indispensable part of freedom.
"For a nation to govern itself without a monarch or authoritarian ruler, its people must be capable of self-government, exercising their liberty responsibly."
"They understood that faith fosters good character, virtue, and self-restraint—qualities that prevent society from falling into chaos."
"Unfortunately, we have seen the proof of this too often in years."
Attacks against faith-based organizations and individuals of particular religious groups are staggeringly high.
"Peaceful pro-life advocates have been unjustly jailed, churches have been vandalized and burned, and students have faced threats and violence on their college campuses due to radical protests."
The emphasis on race and sexual preference over merit have undermined our businesses and schools.
"As faith—and the moral foundations that come with it— declines, so does the well-being and stability of our Nation."
"Yet when religion is allowed to flourish, communities thrive."
"Research shows that faith strengthens the family unit, promotes stable marriages, and discourages drug abuse and violence."
"Regular church attendance is linked to lifting young people out of poverty, and faithful people tend to be happier and more fulfilled in life."
"Our Nation has always been a beacon of hope for those seeking religious freedom, and today we are enriched by a diverse religious heritage."
"This Faith Month, I join Concerned Women for America and millions of Americans to celebrate our distinctly American foundations."

"In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022, and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, Executive Order 14068 of March 11, 2022, Executive Order 14071 of April 6, 2022, and Executive Order 14114 of December 22, 2023, is to continue in effect beyond April 15, 2025."
"Specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation—in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states—continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States."
"Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation."
"THE WHITE HOUSE, April 10, 2025. f REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF A PROCLAMATION PROVIDING EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN STATIONARY SOURCES FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINAL RULE PUBLISHED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TITLED ‘‘NATIONAL EMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS: COALAND OIL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITY STEAM GENERATING UNITS REVIEW OF THE RESIDUAL RISK AND TECHNOLOGY REVIEW,’’ 89 FR 38508 (RULE), WHICH AMENDED THE PREEXISTING MERCURY AND AIR TOXICS STANDARDS RULE TO MAKE IT MORE STRINGENT—PM 23 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works: To the Congress of the United States: Consistent with applicable law, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), I hereby report that I have issued a proclamation providing exemption for certain stationary sources from compliance with the final rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency titled National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coaland Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review, 89 FR 38508 (Rule), which amended the preexisting Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule to make it more stringent."
"As reflected in the proclamation of April 8, 2025 (Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Energy) (Proclamation), coal-fired electricity generation is essential to ensuring that our Nation’s grid is reliable and that electricity is affordable for the American people, and to promoting our Nation’s energy security."
The Federal Government plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the Nation’s power supply remains secure and reliable.
Forcing energy producers to comply with unattainable emissions controls jeopardizes this mission.
"In the Proclamation, I determined that the technology to implement the Rule is not available."
"I further determined in the Proclamation that it is in the national security interests of the United States to issue an exemption from the Rule to certain stationary sources subject to the Rule, as identified in Annex I of the Proclamation."
"The effect of this exemption is to extend the compliance date of the Rule for those stationary sources from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029."
I am enclosing a copy of the Proclamation I have issued and Annex I thereto.

A bill to authorize additional funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
"Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize additional funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act."
"This crucial piece of legislation would simply increase the authorization of funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, SJRRP, which supports one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States while also creating a healthy, living river for Chinook salmon."
"Increasing the cap for the program will enable the Bureau of Reclamation, the State of California, and key partners to advance projects necessary to the continued success of the program."
Our bill retains a provision in the original legislation from 2009 that authorized the SJRRP and set forth a one-for-one match from non-Federal sources for any Federal appropriated dollars.
The bill would also increase the authorization of appropriations to help restore canal capacity for the Friant-Kern and Madera Canals to address subsidence.
"A fully implemented SJRRP is crucial for managing the San Joaquin River system, restoring fish populations, and ensuring reliable water supplies for farmers."
"Without an increased funding cap, Federal support will likely fall short, threatening both water reliability and ecosystem restoration and undermining decades of collaboration and progress."
"That is why our bill is supported by a broad range of agricultural water users, the State of California, and key local partner, because the SJRRP’s success benefits both farmers and the environment."
This type of collaboration demonstrates how we can manage our limited water resources to provide water supply reliability while also benefiting our ecosystems.
"While we were able to pass this bill through the Senate by unanimous consent at the end of 2024, it did not pass the House of Representatives in time to be signed into law."
"I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Chambers to advance this commonsense, straightforward legislation on the floor as soon as possible."
And I thank Senator HOEVEN for his support for my legislation.
"By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. MCCORMICK, Mr. GALLEGO, Mrs."
"BRITT, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. CASSIDY, Mr. CRAPO, and Ms. HIRONO): S. 1415."

"Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the bipartisan Housing Unhoused Disabled Veterans Act, which I introduced today."
Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation for veterans and members of our Armed Forces who have answered the call of duty and sacrificed for our Nation.
"I firmly believe that those who serve our country with honor, courage, and distinction deserve our Nation’s enduring gratitude."
"That VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:54 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10AP6.039 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2566 April 10, 2025 is why I have always been committed to supporting all those who have fought for our Nation’s freedom."
"Currently, many disabled veterans are unable to access housing programs for veterans because of how income is defined."
"The more severe a disability is, the more disability benefits a veteran receives."
"Yet, because of the way total income has historically been determined, this means that veterans receiving the highest amount of disability benefits often cannot access the housing assistance they need."
Congress must ensure that every veteran has access to stable housing.
"While progress has been made in reducing veteran homelessness, there is still more that we must do."
"Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated effort between Federal, State, and local agencies and strong partnerships with nonprofit veteran service organizations and community leaders."
We must do our part to remove redtape and make it easier for veterans to be housed.
I remain committed to supporting policies that expand and increase access to VA homelessness programs for veterans in need.
"I want to thank Senators GALLEGO, MCCORMICK, and BRITT for introducing this bipartisan bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting solutions that ensure no veteran is left without a safe place to call home."
"By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mrs."
"MURRAY, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. MARKEY, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. SCHIFF, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE): S. 1432."
"A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to permanently prohibit oil and gas exploration, development, and production on the outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources."
"Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the West Coast Ocean Protection Act of 2025."
"This crucial piece of legislation would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1978 to permanently prohibit offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington."
"It has been over 50 years since a major oilspill occurred off the coast of Santa Barbara, which inspired the first Earth Day and the modern environmental movement that we see today."
"Despite this catastrophic incident, California has still a experienced subsequent oilspills, which is unacceptable since these environmental incidents are preventable."
I hope my colleagues can join me in understanding that the tradeoff between oil production and environmental harm is simply not one we should be making any longer.
"The oil spills in California have had drastic impacts, including oil seeping into environmentally sensitive wetlands, endangering birds and other wildlife, and forcing the closure of beaches that are the economic engines of entire communities."
"We must end our reliance on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels and work towards a clean energy future, because even when oil isn’t leaking from pipelines, it is fueling the crisis of global warming, poisoning local communities, and causing billions of dollars of harm each year."
Fossil fuels are endangering Californian families and fueling raging wildfires and extreme drought—as well as toxic oilspills.
"I want to recognize the late Senator Feinstein for spearheading this bill year after year during her time in Congress, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to improve our coastal safety and protect our communities."

"A bill to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prevent consumer reporting agencies from furnishing consumer reports under certain circumstances, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs."
"Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. HAGERTY."
This bipartisan legislation restricts the use of so-called mortgage ‘‘trigger leads’’ and gives prospective home buyers control over their personal credit information.
Trigger leads are essentially tips based on information the major credit reporting bureaus sell to mortgage brokers and lenders when the bureaus learn that a consumer has applied for a mortgage with another lender.
"Each trigger lead they sell generates dozens of calls and solicitations to the consumer from lenders, ostensibly to provide the consumer with better offers."
"In fact, one home buyer reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they received over 100 calls within 2 days of applying for a mortgage."
Prospective home buyers who are bombarded by these kinds of solicitations typically have no idea their information was sold without their affirmative consent.
Buying a home is often the most consequential financial decision a family will make.
Getting spammed with additional offers after a family has already shopped for a mortgage and chosen a lender makes this already stressful process even more stressful.
"It can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a family to sift through dozens of offers over a few days and actually receive better credit."
Consumers who are subjected to a deluge of solicitations as the result of a trigger lead are justified in feeling that their privacy has been invaded.
Many reputable mortgage companies see it the same way.
They support curtailing trigger leads since prospective home buyers often blame their lender for selling off their personal information even though it is the credit bureaus that are providing this information.
"Unrelenting, aggressive solicitations are more than just a nuisance."
"Indeed, some companies that buy trigger leads may not use them responsibly and may have poor track records of compliance."
In 2018. the Washington Post reported that some mortgage lenders had used trigger leads to misrepresent themselves in calls by suggesting that they are underwriters for the consumer’s current lender or by implying that they are calling from a government agency.
"According to reporting in the Chicago Tribune, unsuspecting home buyers are at risk of inadvertently handing over sensitive personal information, exposing themselves to identity theft."
The current system leaves consumers without control of their personal information when they apply for a mortgage.
Our bill will fix the current system by significantly restricting the circumstances in which the credit bureaus can sell home buyers’ personal information to generate trigger leads.
The credit bureaus would be permitted to sell this information only in the limited circumstances when the consumer already has a significant financial relationship with the lending institution seeking the information or when the prospective home buyer has provided affirmative consent to share this information broadly with other lenders.
The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act will go a long way towards securing consumers’ personal information and will provide much needed relief from the seemingly never-ending solicitations prospective home buyers receive during an already stressful time.
"Last Congress, the Senate acted unanimously to pass this legislation, and I would like to thank my colleagues for their support."
"However, this legislation was unfortunately not taken up in the House."
"I hope that this Congress, we can work together—on a bicameral, bipartisan basis—to address the abuse of trigger leads once and for all."
"I thank the broad coalition of consumer advocacy groups and trade associations for their support, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its low-income clients, the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, the Community Home Lenders of America, the Consumer Federation of America, Americans for Financial Reform, the Broker Action Coalition, the American Bankers Association, and the Independent Community Bankers of America."

"By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. HEINRICH, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. SCHATZ, Mr. SCHIFF, Mr. WYDEN, and Mr. LUJA´ N): S. 1477."
"A bill to address the homelessness and housing crises, to move toward the goal of providing for a home for all Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs."
"Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Housing for All Act of 2025, which I introduced today."
Our Nation’s homelessness and affordable housing crises have reached a breaking point.
"As of January, 2024, over 771,480 individuals in the U.S.— disproportionately people of color—experienced homelessness."
The rate of homelessness has increased by 18 percent since 2023.
The lack of adequate Federal investments in affordable housing and housing assistance programs are exacerbating these crises.
"There is currently a shortage of 7.1 million affordable and available rental homes in the U.S. According to a recent National Low Income Housing Coalition report, no State or county exists where a person working 40 hours a week and earning the State or local minimum wage can afford to rent a modest two-bedroom apartment."
"Furthermore, over 21 million renters nationwide spend more than 30 percent of their income on just housing costs alone."
The affordable housing and homelessness crises are not just a blue State issue or an urban problem; every State is impacted.
"From our metropolitan areas to our rural heartlands, our constituents everywhere feel the real impact of housing unaffordability."
"It is time for the Federal Government to step up, partner with our State and local governments alongside service providers on the ground and other stakeholders, and invest in solving these problems at a rate commensurate with the need."
"I am proud to re-introduce this bill, which represents a comprehensive approach to tackling housing and homelessness."
"If enacted, it would invest in and align Federal resources to support people experiencing housing instability."
"To address the affordable housing and homelessness crises, we must invest in proven policies that support strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and ensure quality, affordable homes for all."
"Specifically, this bill would address the affordable housing shortage by investing in the housing trust fund, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program, Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program, and the HOME Program."
It establishes a commission to focus on racial equity in housing and homelessness.
"The bill would address homelessness by investing in Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance, emergency solutions grants, and continuums of care."
It also builds on locally developed and driven approaches by creating new grant programs to strengthen mobile crisis intervention teams; to support hotel and motel conversions to permanent supportive housing with services; to aid libraries in supporting persons experiencing homelessness; to provide people living in vehicles with a safe place to park overnight and facilitate a transition to stable housing; and to coordinate behavioral health care with homelessness services.
"And it commissions a report on the connection between evictions and emergency rental assistance during the pandemic, so we can make smarter policies moving forward."
"When I have traveled around California—from Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire—to the Central Valley, San Diego, and San Francisco—to better understand the needs for housing in different communities, some key elements stood out."
"On the production side, there is a need for more dedicated funding for affordable housing from the Federal Government."
"There is also missing middle-income housing for families, especially people of color."
And there is not enough housing near transit.
"That is why my bill focuses on supporting inclusive, transit-oriented development."
"When I talked to researchers about keeping families housed, one main point they made was that we don’t have enough data on renters and evictions, and that is why the bill includes a section on data, so we can make evidence-based policies."
"Right now, the cost to build low-income housing in California is very high in part because of land and material costs and the fragmented way funding is distributed in California."
This is a common problem across the Nation— not just in California.
That is why the bill includes a section to provide technical assistance for localities navigating Federal and State housing funding sources.
"Every person deserves dignity, security, and a space of their own."
"At a time when the current aministration is gutting and dismantling key Housing and Urban Development Department programs and reducing protections for the most vulnerable among us, this bill has never been more important."
Congress must step up so that our Nation’s housing and homelessness crises are dealt with in a comprehensive and holistic way to ensure that every person and family in America has a place to call home.
"I want to thank Representatives TED LIEU and SALUD CARBAJAL for introducing this bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this comprehensive solution to our nationwide affordable housing and homelessness crises. f SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS SENATE RESOLUTION 169—EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE STAFF OF PUBLIC, SCHOOL, ACADEMIC, AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THOSE LIBRARIES PROVIDE TO COMMUNITIES, RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR FUNDING COMMENSURATE WITH THE BROAD SCOPE OF SOCIAL SERVICE AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS PROVIDED BY LIBRARIES, PRESERVING THE RIGHT OF ALL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO FREELY ACCESS INFORMATION AND RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, SUPPORTING A STRONG UNION VOICE FOR LIBRARY WORKERS, AND DEFENDING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF LIBRARY STAFF Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. REED, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. WYDEN, and Mr. VAN HOLLEN) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions: S."

"Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Lt. Gen."
Dan Caine to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I am glad that we will soon be voting on this nominee.
"The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is one of, if not the, most important positions in the U.S. military."
"The Chairman serves as the principal military adviser to the President, the National Security Council, the Secretary of Defense, and Congress."
"They are expected VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:54 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10AP6.057 S10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2578 April 10, 2025 to be an unparalleled strategist, adviser, and manager, and their counsel is invaluable as we confront the multitude of national security issues before us."
General Caine testified before the Armed Services Committee last week and represented himself well.
He has had a distinguished career in the Air Force and the Air National Guard as an F–16 pilot with thousands of flight hours and multiple combat deployments.
"He has also served in senior leadership roles at the Pentagon, the White House, and overseas, including in the special operations and intelligence communities."
"If confirmed, General Caine would be the first career National Guard officer to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
I appreciate General Caine’s record of service and thank him for stepping forward to lead once again.
"However, we must be clear about the unprecedented circumstances that led to General Caine’s nomination."
"Two months ago, President Trump abruptly dismissed Gen."
"CQ Brown, who was not even halfway into his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
"Secretary of Defense Hegseth also dismissed several other senior officers, including ADM Lisa Franchetti, the Chief of Naval Operations; Gen."
"James Slife, the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff; Gen."
"Jennifer Short, the senior military adviser to the Secretary; and all three Judge Advocates General for the Army, Navy, and Air Force."
"Last week, President Trump dismissed Gen."
"Timothy Haugh, the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, at the urging of Laura Loomer, a fringe conspiracy theorist."
"And on Monday, we learned that Secretary Hegseth had dismissed VADM Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. Military Representative to NATO."
"To this day, no credible explanation has been given for the dismissal of a single one of these officers."
We cannot pretend that this is normal or acceptable behavior by the Commander in Chief and Defense Secretary.
"One by one, they are purging officers, threatening others, and undermining the fundamental principles of our military."
"I will speak more about this later, but I am deeply concerned that these officers were dismissed for political reasons."
"I have long warned about the dangers of firing military servicemembers as a political loyalty test, and I will continue to sound the alarm about this behavior."
I must say that that the silence from my Republican friends on this issue is very troubling.
"Even as Republicans vote to confirm General Caine, I hope they recognize the dangerous message that President Trump and Secretary Hegseth are sending throughout the ranks: Don’t speak your mind or give your best military advice, or you may face consequences."
I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in demanding an explanation from the President and Defense Secretary.
I would take a moment to salute Gen.
"CQ Brown, who served this Nation honorably for more than four decades and led the Joint Chiefs with dedication and skill."
"He and each of the officers who were dismissed had outstanding careers in the military and represented our Nation with great courage, honor, and distinction."
We owe all of them a debt of gratitude for their service and sacrifice.
We are fortunate that General Caine understands the fraught situation within which he has been nominated to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
"During his hearing, General Caine repeatedly agreed that the military must remain apolitical."
"When he was asked how he would guard against politicization of the military, General Caine said, ‘‘It starts with being a good example from the top and making sure that we are nonpartisan and apolitical and speaking the truth to power every day.’’ I was also relieved by General Caine’s response to my question about President Trump’s claim that that he once said he ‘‘loved’’ President Trump and would ‘‘kill’’ for him while donning a ‘‘Make America Great Again’’ hat."
"During the hearing, General Caine categorically denied that this incident happened and stated, ‘‘I’ve never worn any political merchandise or said anything to that effect.’’ As the Nation’s seniormost military officer, it will be his responsibility to understand the needs of America’s servicemembers and to be their greatest advocate."
"If confirmed, he will be the most visible military officer in the Nation."
It will be critical for him to represent the force with total professionalism and trustworthiness.
"In my conversations with General Caine and after speaking with those who know him best, I have found him to be an honest, smart, and principled military officer."
He understands the momentous national security challenges we face and has pledged to represent our servicemembers with professionalism and discipline.
"Ultimately, I am optimistic that General Caine will provide his best military advice to the President and the Secretary of Defense, even if that advice not what they would want to hear."
"The Senate Armed Services Committee approved his nomination by a wide, bipartisan margin, and I intend to vote in favor of General Caine now. f CLOTURE MOTION The PRESIDING OFFICER."

"BURGESS OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. OWENS."
"Mr. Speaker, in Utah, we believe in opportunity, hard work, and raising kids with the character to stand tall—not just in the classroom, but in life."
That means giving them more than screens and participation trophies.
"It means real challenges, real discipline, and real opportunities to grow."
That’s why I want to recognize two Utah businesses—Gateway Parks in Spanish Fork and Barn Elite Training in Mapleton—that are stepping up where too many institutions have failed.
"Gateway Parks is making winter sports accessible to kids who might never get the chance, teaching them confidence, grit, and the value of falling down and getting back up."
"Barn Elite Training is giving young athletes a place to push their limits, to build mental and physical toughness in an era when both are in short supply."
"Too many kids today are struggling—with stress, with isolation, and with a culture that pushes them toward passivity instead of purpose."
But these businesses aren’t waiting for permission—they’re taking action.
"And as we refocus on Making America Healthy Again, this is exactly the kind of leadership we should be lifting up."
I’m proud to recognize Gateway Parks and Barn Elite Training for investing in our youth— because a strong America starts with strong kids.

"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Mr. Austin Metcalf of Frisco, Texas, a young student athlete and aspiring leader who tragically passed away on April 2, 2025."
"Austin was a student at Frisco Memorial High School, where he was an honors student, accomplished leader, and star athlete on the Memorial Warriors football team."
He maintained an impressive 4.0 GPA and participated in track and field to supplement his football abilities.
"Moreover, Austin was voted MVP of his football team in the last season and was on the path to become a prospective football recruit for several top universities, all at the young age of 17 years old."
Austin’s warm personality and natural leadership skills made an enormous impact on the lives of those around him.
"He was an exceptional, outgoing young man who lit up any room he was in with his smile."
"Outside of school and sports, Austin worked part-time at Halo Pizzeria in Frisco alongside his twin brother, Hunter."
"Together, they regularly attended church with their youth group and enjoyed going on hunting trips with their family."
"My heart goes out to Hunter and Austin’s parents, Jeff and Meghan Metcalf, during this difficult moment."
Austin’s spirit and legacy will continue to inspire and guide us always.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation’s Capitol in remembrance of Austin’s wonderful life.

"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Kilgore College Rangerettes and to celebrate two remarkable milestones in their storied legacy: the 30th anniversary of the Rangerettes Class of 1995 and the 85th anniversary of this world-renowned team."
"Founded in 1940 by the visionary Gussie Nell Davis, the Kilgore College Rangerettes were the first precision dance team in the United States to perform during a college football halftime show."
Ms. Davis established the team with a bold vision to elevate the collegiate experience and set a new standard of excellence for performance and presentation.
"From their iconic high kicks and jump splits to their timeless red, white, and blue uniforms, the Rangerettes exemplify the best of Texas culture—blending grace, athleticism, and discipline into a performance style recognized around the world."
"Over the decades, the Rangerettes have graced stages from the Cotton Bowl and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade to Presidential Inaugurations, Las Vegas stages, and USO tours abroad."
"Yet it is their commitment to tradition, poise, and teamwork that has inspired generations of young women and helped shape the landscape of precision dance teams across the country."
"The Class of 1995 holds a special place in this legacy, and their 30th anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on their impact, both as performers and as ambassadors of the Rangerette tradition."

"Dr. Benjamin’s contributions have touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers, and it is with great pride that we congratulate him on receiving the Living Legend Award from Christian Theological Seminary on April 23, 2025."
Dr. Benjamin served as Senior Pastor of the Light of the World Christian Church in Indianapolis for over 43 years.
"During his tenure, he mentored and ordained more than 50 ministers, many of whom have earned advanced theological degrees and serve in churches across the nation."
"Dr. Benjamin’s influence beyond the pulpit earned him the title ‘‘City’s Pastor,’’ as he consistently advocated for racial justice, youth empowerment, and the well-being of all people."
"He also co-founded the Celebration of Hope, an interracial and interdenominational worship service, was the first pastor to chair the Mayor’s Human Rights Commission, and sit on the board of directors of a local bank."
Dr. Benjamin is the only pastor in Indianapolis to receive Indiana’s ‘‘Sagamore of the Wabash’’ from four different governors and earn the Indianapolis Whistler Award for community service.
"In retirement, Dr. Benjamin remains dedicated to inspiring and educating young ministers through the Tom Benjamin School of Ministry at Indiana Wesleyan University."
"A respected author, he has written several books focused on uplifting young Black men and emphasizing the crucial role of fathers."
I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Dr. Bishop T.

"Her work at the World Association for Children and Parents (WACAP) reflected a lifelong commitment to the belief that families, in all forms, matter."
That belief would carry through every piece of work she did from the day she answered the call to join my team as a caseworker.
"What was supposed to be a temporary, part-time role turned into seventeen years of relentless dedication."
"Over those years, Ruth became a cornerstone of the office."
Her reputation extended far beyond our district.
"People from around the country reached out—not to the office, but to Ruth—because they knew she would get the job done."
"Whether it was an immigration case, an adoption, a visa crisis, or helping someone reunite with family, Ruth took every issue personally."
"She fought for constituents as if they were her own loved ones—and in many ways, they were."
"She fiercely advocated for individuals and families caught in the immigration system, helped countless people through difficult legal mazes, and never let up."
"And while her professional accomplishments are remarkable, those of us lucky enough to know her personally know that Ruth also had a softer, deeply generous side."
She was a talented quilter who would quietly craft beautiful gifts for staff members welcoming new children.
Her commitment to immigration work was a natural extension of her devotion to them.
"And, of course, we’d be remiss not to mention her favorite drink: a strong gin and tonic, a detail that feels just as Ruth as anything else."
Ruth made me and our team better.
"Her impact isn’t measured just in policies or case numbers, but in the lives she touched."
"Through her work, families were reunited, futures were restored, and faith was renewed in the idea that government can, in fact, work for the people."
"So today, we remember Ruth not just as a colleague, but as a mentor, a fighter, and a friend."
"Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Ruth Clapp for her distinguished career and life of service."
"Her legacy lives on in the work we continue to do, and in every person whose life she changed for the better. f RECOGNIZING JAVIER RANGEL HON."

This remarkable accomplishment speaks to the extraordinary talent and dedication of the student-athletes and coaching staff.
"The women’s team claimed its second consecutive national championship, dominating the field and finishing 46 points ahead of their closest competitors."
"Their impressive victory continued just two days later, as they claimed first place in the NJCAA Half Marathon National Championship, a historic feat for SLCC and a significant milestone in women’s athletics at the college."
"On the men’s side, the Bruins secured second place in the NJCAA Half Marathon National Championship, demonstrating their competitive edge and depth of talent."
"These achievements would not have been possible without the leadership of Head Coach Isaac Wood, who was named NJCAA National Coach of the Year, along with Assistant Coaches Kelsey Gilbert, Aiden Carlson, and Tom Gruenewald."

"TORRES OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mrs."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sergeant Jess Gomez, Jr., and his commitment to our nation throughout his three years of military service and twelve years of service in the U.S. Army National Guard (USANG)."
"During his service with the USANG, he achieved the rank of Sergeant with Service Battery 2/144 Field Artillery."
"In 1965, on Christmas Day, Sergeant Gomez was deployed to Vietnam, and in July of 1968, he was honorably discharged."
"Sergeant Gomez further answered the call to service with the USANG, demonstrating his dedication to protecting and serving his community."
"His unit was located at the U.S. Armory in Arcadia, California, where he participated in monthly weekend drills and annual Summer Camp for two and a half weeks."
"He was loved by many in his personal and professional life, including his section of Ammo buddies, with whom he kept in touch throughout his life."
"As a result of his service, Sergeant Gomez was praised by local leaders for his dedication to protecting the safety of his local and greater community, regardless of the need."
He was an Army truck driver for firefighters during the Northern California Red Bluff fires.
"In 1992, during the Rodney King riots, he was called out to protect cities in the Los Angeles area."
The community was known to express genuine respect and heartfelt gratitude toward him and his team for the protection they provided as members of the National Guard.
"Following Sergeant Gomez’s military and USANG service, he became a loyal member of Vietnam Veterans of America’s (VVA) Chapter 47 and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 12034."
"Not only did he spread awareness for the VVA by serving as a board member and by joining his chapter in local parades, but he also volunteered for the VVA Food Pantry."
Mr. Gomez’s work with the VVA Food Pantry was critical to ensuring more than 500 veterans received essential food products each week throughout the Greater Los Angeles region.
"VFW Post 12034 remembers Sergeant Gomez fondly for his mentorship of younger and incoming veterans, praising him for embodying the phrase ‘‘still serving.’’ He regularly attended community events to increase membership and engagement, and could be found annually at Rancho Remembers, ensuring high schoolers could understand the experiences of veterans."
"During a challenging time when our city faced funding cuts that led to the potential closure of Pomona’s beloved library, Sergeant Gomez showed up for his community—organizing and protecting a space that serves as a cornerstone for learning and dedication."
His tireless efforts not only safeguarded the Pomona library but also inspired a renewed sense of unity and purpose.
"For his outstanding accomplishments, it is my honor to recognize Sergeant Jess Gomez, Jr. His civic service and commitment to both California and our Nation are worthy of the highest commendation. f HONORING JIM BRANDENBURG HON."
"BETTY McCOLLUM OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Ms. MCCOLLUM."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of an iconic figure in the world of wildlife photography, Jim Brandenburg."
"Jim passed away at home in Minnesota on April 4, 2025, at the age of 79."
"He is survived by his spouse, Judy, daughter Heidi and her husband Nels Pierson, and grandchildren Olivia, Liam, and Lindsey."
"Born and raised in Minnesota, Brandenburg’s career began in the early 1970s, and he quickly gained recognition for his ability to humanize animals through images."
His work as a staff photographer for National Geographic further solidified his reputation in the field of wildlife photography.
"He was named Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 1988, and Magazine Photographer of the Year by the National Press Photographers Association in 1981 and 1983."
"Of the 40 most important nature photographs of all time, chosen by the International League of Conservation Photographers, four are by Jim Brandenburg."
"In 2023, Jim became one of just six photographers to earn the National Geographic Lifetime Achievement Award."
Jim’s ability to artfully capture the unique and beautiful landscapes and wildlife of Minnesota is perhaps his clearest legacy.
"By choosing to focus his lens on the animals of the Upper Midwest, he highlighted the exceptional ecosystems and biodiversity of our region, including wolves."
"In fact, two of his most renowned photographs are of wolves: one capturing a white wolf leaping between ice floes in the Arctic, the other a gray wolf staring directly into his lens, watching Jim from behind a tree in his own backyard in northern Minnesota."
"Jim’s work conveys his deep respect and empathy for the animals he photographs, which helped him to capture moments that transcend mere documentation."
His photographs invite viewers to pause and consider the lives of the creatures that share our planet.
"In addition to his photographic contributions, Jim Brandenburg has been a tireless advocate for conservation."
His work has been instrumental in raising awareness about the environmental challenges facing the Upper Midwest and advocating for the preservation of wilderness areas including Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
"Jim also worked with another famous adventureradvocate from Minnesota, the explorer Will Steger, helping to document Will’s polar expeditions."
The United Nations Environmental Programme awarded Jim the World Achievement Award in recognition of his work to raise public awareness of the need to protect our planet’s natural habitats.
Jim Brandenburg’s legacy extends far beyond his photographic achievements.
"He has inspired photographers, conservationists, and nature lovers with his unique ability for capturing the soul of the wild."
"Through his work, he has shown us that nature is something to be cherished and protected."
"As we reflect on his life and career, we must honor not only his photographic contributions but also his commitment to the preservation of the natural world for future generations."
"Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the remarkable life and work of Jim Brandenburg. f HONORING THE CAREER OF POLICE CHIEF ROWDY KAGARISE HON."

"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Williamsburg Police Chief Rowdy Kagarise, who is retiring on April 30, 2025, after a distinguished 23-year career with the Williamsburg Police Department."
Chief Kagarise holds distinctions as the longest-serving Chief of Police in Williamsburg and the first ever to retire from the department.
His primary goal has always been to help ensure that Williamsburg remains a safe community to live in.
"Admired for a common-sense approach and communication skills that many times defused tense situations during police interventions, Chief Kagarise began his career with the department as a part-time police officer in 2001."
"A Williamsburg native, he was appointed officer-in-charge in 2010 and chief of police in 2011."
"In describing his philosophy on police work in Williamsburg, Chief Kagarise commented that, ‘‘It all comes down to caring about this community.’’ On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I congratulate Police Chief Rowdy Kagarise on his retirement VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:42 Apr 11, 2025 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A10AP8.016 E10APPT1 dmwilson on DSK7X7S144PROD with REMARKS CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E311 April 10, 2025 and express fond wishes for joy and contentment in all future endeavors. f RECOGNIZING JACKSON ROGERS HON."

"BURGESS OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. OWENS."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor K9 Officer Andy Maybo of the U.S. Capitol Police, whose tireless work has ensured that our fallen heroes are never forgotten."
"For years, Officer Maybo has been at the heart of organizing the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service, coordinating with Congress, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Secret Service, and the U.S. Park Police."
"His dedication has been particularly impactful for Utah’s fallen officers, ensuring that their families were properly honored at this important event."
"In addition to his role in the memorial, Andy served as president of DC FOP Lodge 1 and contributed to several other lodge committees."
"As Andy steps down from his role on the National FOP Memorial Committee this May, we owe him our deepest gratitude for his leadership and service."
His unwavering commitment has made a lasting impact on the families of fallen officers across the nation.
I thank Officer Maybo for his years of service and dedication.
"May God bless him, and may God bless the United States of America f HONORING THE LEGACY AND DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVICE OF REYNAUD LAVARNCE WALLACE HON."
"JIM COSTA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. COSTA."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy, and dedicated public service of Reynaud LaVarnce Wallace, a pillar of the Fresno community."
"Born on October 18, 1952, in Montgomery, Alabama, Reynaud was the eldest of six children born to Carl Phillip and Ernestine Jackson Wallace."
"In 1957, the Wallace family embarked on a journey westward, leaving Montgomery with their sons Reynaud and Rodney."
"The family eventually settled in the Nickerson Gardens Housing Project in Watts, Los Angeles, after stops in San Diego and San Francisco."
"There, young Reynaud earned the affectionate nickname ‘‘Silver’’, owing to a silver crown that adorned a chipped front tooth—an incident the precise details of which remain unconfirmed, as noted by his ever-loyal brother."
"Following the tumult of the 1965 Watts Riots, the Wallace family relocated to Altadena, California, where Reynaud attended Eliot Junior High School and John Muir High School."
"A bright and energetic student, Reynaud immersed himself in both academic and extracurricular pursuits, most notably as a member of the John Muir Cadet Corps, the precursor to the school’s ROTC program."
He graduated in June 1970 and pursued his passion for justice and community service by studying Police Science in college.
"In 1975, Reynaud married the love of his life, Deborah Ann Drayton."
"He went on to serve as Security Manager for Zody’s Department Store in Pasadena and, in 1979, was entrusted with the leadership of the security team opening a new Zody’s location in Fresno, California."
It was in Fresno that the couple would welcome their daughter Jasmine in 1987.
"Reynaud, or ‘‘Rey’’ as he came to be known, joined the Fresno Police Department in December 1981, beginning a storied and impactful career in public service that spanned nearly three decades."
"His legacy is perhaps best encapsulated in his founding of the Fresno Police Activities League (PAL) in 1992—an initiative that grew to include 30 programs and served more than 3,500 youth annually, helping to build trust and hope in the community he so dearly loved."
"His accolades and achievements are too numerous to list in full, but among them are the Life Saving Medal of Valor (1985), Fresno Human Relations Commission Award (2003), NAACP Image Awards (1993 and 2005), African American Heritage Award (2008), and the Risk Taker and Dream Maker Award."
"He served as President of the Fresno Black Police Officers Association, was appointed to the California State Commission on Juvenile Justice, and offered his guidance at both the state and national levels of PAL."
"Despite the seriousness of his work, Rey’s personality left an indelible mark."
"Known affectionately as ‘‘Chocolate Thunder’’, he was a force of nature—compassionate, commanding, and charismatic—whose legend, like his nickname, was built on stories his brother, in good humor, will neither confirm nor deny."
"Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of Reynaud LaVarnce Wallace who embodied the spirit of public service, community empowerment, and family devotion."
TOWN OF HILLIARD REMEMBERS OUR VIETNAM VETERANS HON.
"AARON BEAN OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. BEAN of Florida."
"Mr. Speaker, President Calvin Coolidge once said, ‘‘The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself forgotten.’’ His words perfectly encapsulate the importance of remembering our Vietnam War veterans."
"I rise today with great honor to recognize the legacy and great sacrifice of our Vietnam War veterans through The Wall That Heals, which will be on display in Nassau County, Florida, from April 17th through April 21st at the Northeast Florida Fairgrounds."
"The Wall That Heals is a half-scale replica of the permanent memorial in Washington, D.C., that stands six feet tall at the center and covers almost 300 feet from end to end."
"The traveling exhibition will be a unique opportunity for individuals in our community, including the 26,900 Vietnam Veterans who call the Fourth Congressional District of Florida home, to see the names of their loved ones and comrades who otherwise may not be able to make the trip to Washington."
"I would like to thank the Town of Hilliard, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10095, and all the volunteers who dedicated their time and effort to bring this distinct honor to Northeast Florida."
"Mr. Speaker, we will never be able to repay our debt to those who have given their last measure of devotion for the spirit of America."
But we can continue to do our duty: to remember.
May the lives of those who served and were killed during the Vietnam War never be forgotten. f COMMEMORATING MR.

"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable career of Dana Skelton, who retired in July 2024 after 42 years of dedicated service to the students and community of Terrell Independent School District."
Dana’s legacy in Terrell ISD began in 1982 when he stepped into the role of Director of the Terrell High School Band.
"Under his leadership, the Tiger Band flourished, earning UIL Superior and Sweepstakes ratings, performing at Texas Stadium, and achieving excellence at the Texas State Solo & Ensemble Contest."
"Dana’s commitment to building a strong, disciplined program transformed the band into one of the finest in the state, growing from just 68 members in the 1980s to 192 by 2000."

"In 2000, he became the district’s Fine Arts & District Projects Director, where he helped design and build the Terrell ISD Performing Arts Center."
"Since its completion, the Performing Arts Center has become a home for artistic expression and a gathering place for students and residents alike."
Dana’s influence extended far beyond the walls of the school.
"He worked tirelessly to ensure that the arts remained a vital part of the Terrell community, promoting a sense of pride and bringing people together through music, theater, and the performing arts."
His leadership in securing funding for the Terrell ISD Excellence Foundation and organizing the E!
Terrell Entertainment Series helped elevate Terrell’s cultural landscape for years to come.
"I extend my deepest gratitude to Dana Skelton for his decades of service, leadership, and unwavering dedication to the students and families of Terrell."
His impact on the community will be felt for generations.

"PAT FALLON OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. FALLON."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Heart’s Desire in Frisco, Texas."
"In 1995, Sherri Hale and Molly Hoebeke founded Heart’s Desire, the first gift shop in Frisco."
What started off as a hobby between friends has transformed into a very successful small business and a must-visit attraction for Frisco residents and tourists.
"From gourmet food, jewelry, handbags, to lake-themed gifts, Heart’s Desire offers an incredible, diverse selection of goods and a warm, welcoming environment for visitors."
"When conceptualizing name ideas for the store, Sherri and Molly leaned on their faith for inspiration and ultimately settled on ‘‘Heart’s Desire,’’ a reference from Psalm 37:4, to encapsulate the feeling you get when you walk through their doors."
They attribute the business’ success to their dedicated patrons and their hardworking staff.
"Now open for over three decades, visitors from all over the world have enjoyed the authentic and exceptional customer service experience in Heart’s Desire."
"For their incredible commitment to serving the needs of customers and the community, Heart’s Desire has received the Best in DFW People’s Choice Award for best gift shop and Frisco STYLE Magazine’s Best of Business— Outstanding Experience Award."

"JUAN VARGAS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. VARGAS."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Roosevelt Brown, an outstanding member of our community who has served the youth in San Diego for more than 40 years."
"Mr. Brown spent his formative years in the San Diego school system, attending Logan Elementary School, Memorial Junior High School, and San Diego High School."
"At a young age, Mr. Brown struggled with a speech impediment that hindered his academic progress."
He feared being called on by teachers to read or speak aloud due to his stutter.
It is this limitation that inspired his community work.
"Mr. Brown pursued several professional avenues following his high school graduation, and in his thirties, he decided to take classes at the University of Redlands and San Diego City College."
These courses nurtured a newfound passion for reading.
"He decided to channel this passion into community work, with a goal to make sure children didn’t have to wait as long as he did to discover the joys of reading."
He knew that reading opened doors to learning and confidence.
"Mr. Brown began his ‘‘Children’s Book Party’’ in his backyard, aiming for every child to form a collection of books."
"The books covered a variety of subjects including math, science, short stories, and novels."
His continued dedication expanded the program to the Education Cultural Complex and then the Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park.
"His book parties have come to fruition through the nonprofit he founded 35 years ago, ‘‘Reading Literacy Learning, Inc.’’ Mr. Brown’s dedication to his nonprofit and community work has allowed him to overcome challenges throughout the years."
"During the COVID–19 pandemic, he still delivered books to schools."
His efforts have proven fruitful as his nonprofit has distributed over a million books to children in the San Diego Community.
"Mr. Brown’s family has been heavily involved in his community work, with the support of his wife aiding in the success of his nonprofit, and his children recently taking over the operations of his book parties."
"Mr. Brown was honored as the 52nd District Constituent of the Month in February 2025, when Black History Month was celebrated, for his dedication to providing learning opportunities to the youth of San Diego, which will undoubtably impact generations to come. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON."

"DARREN SOTO OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. SOTO."
"Mr. Speaker, Bobby Beagles diligently served the agriculture community throughout his career."
"Agricultural issues were always better served with Bobby as an advocate at the county, state, and national levels."
"As a cattle rancher, Bobby early on recognized that ‘‘what was good for all agriculture was good for his farm.’’ in effect, he embraced the idea that ‘‘all boats rise with the tide.’’ As such, he embarked on a path of agricultural advocacy."
"Whether it be at a local community meeting or hundreds of county board meetings, Bobby was a voice to be reckoned with."
He was unrelenting and tireless in representing agriculture.
His legislative advocacy at all levels of government was never-ending.
It was no surprise when Bobby was asked to be then-Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Tom Feeney’s agricultural liaison.
"He carried that privilege and honor to Washington, D.C., when Speaker Feeney became Congressman Feeney."
Bobby’s heart was always about the youth— from the earliest days of buying animals at the county fair to timelessly encouraging auto dealerships and any number of businesses to purchase the kids’ market livestock project.
"On a not-to-be-ignored side note, at the request of then-Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs, Bobby was asked to rewrite the livestock section of the zoning laws."
These laws today allow FFA and 4H to house some of their agriculture projects at home.
His work with the youth led to numerous awards from the local FFA chapters as well as the state and national associations.
He was honored to be awarded the Honorary Florida State FFA Degree and the American FFA Degree.
"In addition to those accolades, he was inducted into the Florida 4-H Hall of Fame."
Bobby served as Orange County Farm Bureau executive director for 13 years.
"Prior to that, he was a board member for 17 years."
His work in this capacity has made him ‘‘Mr. Agriculture’’ in our area of the state.
"In 2007, Bobby received the prestigious Jefferson Award."
This award is given to an individual who has devoted their life to exceptional public service in any arena.
He was nominated for this award by then-Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty and Orange County Extension.
This represented a body of work that included procuring $12 million for the construction of a new extension office in Orange County.
This refrain is consistent with Bobby Beagles’ character.
"In 2002, Bobby was awarded the Friend of Extension Award from Epsilon Sigma Phi State."
This award traditionally recognizes individuals who have been true Friends of Extension.
"A year after receiving the Jefferson Award, Bobby received the Florida Farm Bureau’s Distinguished Service Award."
The award honors Florida agriculturalists for their overall contributions to farming at the local or state level.
"Bobby Beagles was married to Vickie Beagles and had a son, Thomas Beagles, a daughter, Rachel Kelly, and five grandchildren. f VALUING TRUTH ‘FULLNESS’: LESSONS FROM JURY TRIALS HON."
"JAMIE RASKIN OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. RASKIN."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the profound responsibility that accompanies public service."
"As public officials across the country are sworn into office, each affirms a commitment to faithfully execute the duties of public office and defend the Constitution of the United States."
But more and more Americans are losing faith that the actions of our public officials are principally guided by our Constitution and our laws.
"And some of my colleagues even doubt whether truth exists and whether government can operate on the basis of mutually agreed facts, such as who won an election."
Gregory Mize—a Georgetown University law professor and retired trial judge—offers a compelling perspective: we can use jury trials as models for attaining higher levels of truthfulness and reliable outcomes in government.
"After all, our whole justice system is based on the idea that we must all tell the truth and the fact-finder can decide ‘‘beyond a reasonable doubt’’ or ‘‘by preponderance of the evidence’’ what actually happened."
"Thomas Jefferson said, ‘‘I consider trial by jury as the only anchor, yet ever imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.’’ Indeed, the way a courtroom pursues truth provides a blueprint for encouraging trustworthiness in our public servants."
"At the beginning of jury selection, potential jurors take a solemn oath to truthfully answer questions posed by the judge and lawyers."
"The selected jurors take a second oath to ‘‘faithfully discharge the duties of a juror and a true verdict render according to the law and the evidence.’’ When testimony begins, jurors observe each witness take an oath under penalty of perjury to ‘‘tell the truth and nothing but the truth.’’ Judges, also sworn to follow the law, enforce rules of evidence—including by striking irrelevant or unreliable testimony from consideration by the jury."
"In some cases, judges must also pre-qualify proposed experts before they can state an opinion on a key issue."
A lawyer’s questioning then further tests the reliability of those opinions.
"Thanks to these established procedures, jurors learn the court’s high valuation of honesty and come to expect it from their government Rather than relying on a single robed jurist to render a final verdict, our Founders wanted a panel of common citizens to administer justice in honest dialogue with one another."
They believed jury deliberations to be a gold standard for reaching truth and achieving just ends.
"After hearing evidence and receiving legal instructions from the judge, jurors enter a deliberation room."
They test one another’s recollections and assumptions and assess witness credibility.
"Studies show that, during deliberations, a jury polices itself."
Individual jurors remind others of the obligations of their oaths and the requirements of the law as stated by the judge.
"As a new year—with a new Congress and President—is underway, it is high time to bring courtroom reverence for truth-telling into the government generally and the public square."
"As citizens, we must demand a commitment to the pursuit of truth from all of our public officials."
"While enforcing oaths of office is a big challenge, citizens must demand truth from public officials in all that we do."
"And as public officials, we must earn that trust by honoring our oaths."
The work of Judge Gregory Mize is exemplary in calling America back to the bedrock quest for truth.
We owe him a debt of gratitude. f RECOGNIZING THE OLYMPUS HIGH SCHOOL TITANS HON.

"JIM COSTA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, April 10, 2025 Mr. COSTA."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Mr. Lue N."
"Yang, an extraordinary advocate, organizer, teacher, and public figure."
"Born on April 10, 1955, in Xieng Khouang, Laos, Mr. Yang has been a pillar for the Hmong community."
"At the age of 14, he served with the Hmong Special Guerrilla Unit (SGU) during Vietnam."
"After serving with the SGU, Mr. Yang moved to Vientiane to continue his education."
"Upon graduating, he became a Peace Officer for the US Embassy from 1972 to 1975."
"Shortly after, Mr. Yang fled to Thailand as many Hmong refugees did at the end of the Vietnam War."
"A year later in Hawaii, he began to work with the non-profit: Vietnamese Indochinese Volunteer Agency (VIVA) and the Department of Labor as an agent."
"A few years later, Mr. Yang moved to Des Moines, Iowa and worked for Volunteer Enrichment Services."
"In 1991, he moved to Fresno and worked briefly with the Lao Family Community of Fresno."
"In 1992, Mr. Yang began his work at the Fresno Center for New Americans, a local non-profit that serves the Southeast Asian Community."
Later that year he served as the Executive Director for FCNA from 1992 to 2017.
"Under Mr. Yang’s leadership, FCNA managed to grow fourteen programs with an annual budget of $6.8 million and a team of 38."
"As an Executive Director, he was seen as a role model and mentor by many young Hmong professionals at FCNA, who continued to push for progress for the Hmong community."
"Furthermore, during Mr. Yang’s tenure at FCNA he was able to establish several key sustainable programs."
The Living Well was the first Hmong mental health program in the state that provided culturally competent mental health services.
Mr. Yang also drafted an Adult Day Health Care program that provided essential support for senior community members.
These two programs are still in operation today and are seen as the pillars of FCNA’s work.
Mr. Yang has been an advocate for refugees and immigrants for 41 years.
"He has worked collaboratively with non-profits, community leaders, elected officials, and educational institutions to address the disparities, challenges, and stigma that the Southeast Asian communities face."
"Mr. Yang’s work via his community partnerships and advocacy resulted in the hiring of the first Hmong detective in the Fresno Police Department, and Hmong representation in administration and other leadership positions within the Fresno Unified School District."
"He was also instrumental in helping Hmong refugees who were attending school, manage their transition."
"Mr. Yang helped secure funding for a group that went to Wat Tham Krabok, Thailand, the location of the last recognized Hmong refugee group."
"After assessing different challenges unique to the Hmong refugee population, including access to education, the group published its findings to the City and County of Fresno, as well as the State Refugee Office."
"This was what culminated with the creation of the New American School, which assisted Hmong student refugees as they transitioned into mainstream school."
The work of Mr. Yang has given the Hmong community immense support over the years and without this work many of these accomplishments wouldn’t have been possible.
"Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of Lue N."
"He will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. f HONORING 60 YEARS OF GRAPHICS UNIVERSAL OF GREENCASTLE, PENNSYLVANIA HON."

"That philosophy is based on treating clients as long-term partners, fostering a rewarding work experience for staff, adhering to the highest standards of integrity and maintaining respect for the environment."
Gary and Nancy’s son Garon Gembe proudly expands upon their legacy of achievement as Company President.
"Effectively employing a relationship-centered approach with all stakeholders, the team at Graphics Universal prides itself on a commitment to collaboration, open communication and trusted service."

"Mr. Finke was born on July 27, 1987, in Denison, Texas."
"He attended Denison High School and graduated from Austin College in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in business, where he was a star athlete and captain of its football and baseball teams."
"In his outstanding football career, Mr. Finke was recognized numerous times as the All-Conference performer, Conference Player of the week, and the National Defensive Back of the week."
He also earned the Shellie Hersch Special Teams Player of the Year and was named the Duke Babb Most Outstanding Player as a senior.
"Upon graduating, Mr. Finke heeded the call to serve his nation and joined the United States Army to serve as an Orthopedic Technician."
"In 2019, he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve as the Movement and Security Non-Commissioned Officer InCharge."
"Mr. Finke received a battlefield promotion for his contributions to the war effort against terrorist forces in this operation and also earned his Air Assault Badge, German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge in Gold, and Norwegian Ruck March Badge."
"Moreover, Mr. Finke won first place in the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command NCO of the Year Best Warrior Competition, out of a cadre of 6,000 soldiers."
"Outside of his Army duties, Mr. Finke was a devoted husband to his wife, Chelsey, and a father to three beautiful daughters."
He was an uplifting leader who enjoyed playing football with kids in his neighborhood and his Army buddies.
"You could always count on Mr. Finke to be there and push you to be better than you were yesterday, both physically and mentally."
"His legacy of compassion, integrity, and friendship will always be remembered."
I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize Mr. Finke’s incredible life and service to our Nation.
